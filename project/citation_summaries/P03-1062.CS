Figure 2: Parameter optimization described by (Marsi et al. , 2003) but is similar in the sense that it computes a best-performing parameter setting for each data fold.


However, recent research (Daelemans and Hoste, 2002; Marsi et al. , 2003) has shown that machine learners often profit from parameter optimization (i.e. finding the best performing parameters on some development data).

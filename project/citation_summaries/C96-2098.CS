(Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996) has proposed a method for obtaining the bilingual word pairs by optimizing the matrix of the translation probabilities so that the distance of the matrices of the probabilities of co-occurrences of words which appeared in each language might become small. 
Co-occurrence statistics is collected from either bilingual parallel and 334 non-parallel corpora (Smadja et al. , 1996; Kupiec, 1993; Wu, 1995; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Fung and Lo, 1998), or monolingual corpora (Smadja, 1993; Fung and Wu, 1994; Liu and Li, 1997; Shiitze, 1992; Yarowsky, 1995). 
Comparable corpora have been studied extensively in the literature  e.g.,(Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1995; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Franz et al. , 1998; Ballesteros and Croft, 1998; Masuichi et al. , 2000; Sadat et al. , 2004), but transliteration in the context of comparable corpora has not been well addressed. 
Co-occurrence information between neighboring words and words in the same sentence has been used in phrase extraction (Smadja, 1993; Fung and Wu, 1994), phrasal translation (Smadja et al. , 1996; Kupiec, 1993; Wu, 1995; Dagan and Church, 1994), target word selection (Liu and Li, 1997; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996), domain word translation (Fung and Lo, 1998; Fung, 1998), sense disambiguation (Brown et al. , 1991; Dagan et al. , 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994; Gale et al. , 1992a; Gale et al. , 1992b; Gale et al. , 1992c; Shiitze, 1992; Gale et al. , 1993; Yarowsky, 1995), and even recently for query translation in cross-language IR as well (Ballesteros and Croft, 1998). 
Like our method, researches which are not based on the assumption of the sentence alignments for parallel corpora have been done (Kaji and Aizono, 1996; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Fung, 1997).

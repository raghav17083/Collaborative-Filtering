For the distributional similarity component we employ the similarity scheme of (Geffet and Dagan, 2004), which was shown to yield improved predictions of (non-directional) lexical entailment pairs. 
Feature weighting Geffet and Dagan (2004) have reported on that the better quality of feature vector (weighting function) leads better results. 
The earliest work in this direction are those of (Hindle, 1990), (Lin, 1998), (Dagan et al., 1999), (Chen and Chen, 2000), (Geffet and Dagan, 2004) and (Weeds and Weir, 2005). 
3.2.2 Distributional Similarity Candidates As mentioned in Section 2, we employ the distributional similarity measure of (Geffet and Dagan, 2004) (denoted here GD04 for brevity), which was found effective for extracting nondirectional lexical entailment pairs. 
Geffet and Dagan (2004) propose an approach to improve the quality of the feature vectors used in distributional similarity measures: instead of weighting features using the mutual information value between the word and the feature, they propose to use a measure they call Relative Feature Focus: the sum of the similarities to the (globally) most 5There is a degradation in precision for the pattern-based approach, but not for the GermaNet-based approach, which is why we do not use a distance limit for the GermaNet-based approach.

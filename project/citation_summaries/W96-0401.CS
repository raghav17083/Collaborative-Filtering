The Sentence Planner (Wanner and Hovy, 1996) uses rules to refine a single initial tree representation, in contrast, RTPI operates on sets of complete, independent text plan trees. 
1 Focus and word order determination as sentence planning tasks This paper addresses aspects of the control of intonation belonging to the area of sentence planning \[Beale et al. , 1998: Wanner and Hovy, 1996\]. 
The scope of the variations of linguistic cohesive devices we would like to consider here largely covers the matters of sentence planning (or micro planning) (Wanner and Hovy, 1996; Reiter and Dale, 1999) including referring expressions, discourse markers, sentence grouping, clause configuration, topicalization, etc. In the following sections, we first review the literature on choice of cohesive devices in text generation in section 2. 
\[Nirenburg et al. 1989\] and more recently, \[Wanner and Hovy1996\] advocate a blackboard control mechanism, arguing that the order of sentence planning tasks cannot be pre-determined. 
Although there have been quite a few studies on individual aspects of sentence planning, little attention has been paid to the interaction between the various tasks--exceptions are Rambow and Korelsky (1992) and Wanner and Hovy (1996)--and in particular to the role of marker choice in the overall sentence planning process.

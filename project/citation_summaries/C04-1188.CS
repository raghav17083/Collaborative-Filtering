In the off-line strategy we use syntactic patterns to extract information from unrestricted text to be stored in fact tables (Jijkoun et al. , 2004). 
swering (Jijkoun et al. , 2004) or shallow semantic interpretation systems (Collins and Miller, 1998; Ge and Mooney, 2005). 
The second and more closely related class deals with extracting specific facts such as birthplace, occupation, etc. For this task, the primary theme of work in the literature has been to treat the task as a general semantic-class learning problem where one starts with a few seeds of the semantic relationship of interest and learns contextual patterns such as <NAME> was born in <Birthplace> or <NAME> (born <Birthdate>) (Hearst, 1992; Riloff, 1996; Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Mann and Yarowsky, 2003; Jijkoun et al., 2004; Mann and Yarowsky, 2005; Alfonseca et al., 2006; Pasca et al., 2006). 
Conversely, output annotated with more informative labels, such as function or semantic labels, underlies all domain-independent question answering (Jijkoun et al. , 2004) or shallow semantic interpretation systems (Collins and Miller, 1998; Ge and Mooney, 2005). 
However, manual pattern construction critically depends on the domain knowledge of the pattern designer and often has low coverage (Jijkoun et al. , 2004).

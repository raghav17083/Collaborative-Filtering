INTRODUCTION In a recent paper we presented (Delmonte, 1983) a phonological processor for Italian which has been implemented at the University of Venice and is used in a text-to-speech system (Delmonte et al. , 1984) for the synthesis of Italian at the Centre of Computational Sonology of the University of Padua.


FOCUS STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONAL REVERSIBILITY We already discussed elsewhere (Delmonte, 1983, 1984) rules for Focus Assignment, where Focus was directly compared to Intonational Centre, thus prosodic focus rather than semantic or informational focus.

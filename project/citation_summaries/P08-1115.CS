Recently, several studies have shown that offering more alternatives of annotations to SMT systems will result in significant improvements, such as replacing 1-best trees with packed forests (Mi et al., 2008) and replacing 1-best word segmentations with word lattices (Dyer et al., 2008). 
Lattice parsing is not new to translation (Dyer et al., 2008), but to our knowledge it has not been used in this way. 
Recent work has shown that by combining a variety of segmentations of the input into a segmentation lattice and effectively marginalizing over many different segmentations, translations superior to those resulting from any single single segmentation of the input can be obtained (Xu et al., 2005; Dyer et al., 2008; DeNeefe et al., 2008). 
4.2 Word Lattice Generation Previous research on generating word lattices relies on multiple monolingual segmenters (Xu et al., 2005; Dyer et al., 2008). 
This problem has been widely acknowledged, and the conventional solution, which has been shown to work well for many language pairs, is to segment compounds into their constituent morphemes using either morphological analyzers or empirical methods and then to translate from or to this segmented variant (Koehn et al., 2008; Dyer et al., 2008; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006).

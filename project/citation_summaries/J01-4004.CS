Supervised machine learning algorithms have been used for pronoun resolution (Ge et al. , 1998) and for the resolution of definite NPs (Aone and Bennett, 1995; McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Soon et al. , 2001). 
In a typical machine learning-based coreference resolution system (Soon et al. , 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002b; Yang et al. , 2003; Luo et al. , 2004), a statistical model is learned from training data and is used to measure how likely an anaphor 1 is coreferential to a candidate antecedent. 
We construct this entity-mention graph by learning to decide for each mention which preceding mention, if any, belongs in the same equivalence class; this approach is commonly called the pairwise coreference model (Soon et al., 2001). 
It was criticized (Soon et al. , 2001) that the features used by McCarthy and Lehnert (1995) are highly idiosyncratic and applicable only to one particular domain. 
Since Soon (Soon et al., 2001) started the trend of using the machine learning approach by using a binary classifier in a pairwise manner for solving co-reference resolution problem, many machine learning-based systems have been built, using both supervised and, unsupervised learning methods (Haghighi and Klein, 2007).

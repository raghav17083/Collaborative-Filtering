It is also the case that, though quite a few computational grammars and dictionaries with comprehensive coverage have been used in various application systems, to re-use them for other application domains is not always so easy, even if we use the same formalisms and programs such as parsers, etc. We usually have to revise, add, and delete grammar rules and lexical entries in order to adapt them to the peculiarities of languages (sublanguages) of new application domains \[Sekine et al. , 1992; Tsujii et al. , 1992; Ananiadou, 1990\].


We focus on the first problem in this paper, while readers who are interested in the second problem can refer to \[Sekine et al. , 1992\] In the following, we call the tuples generated from sample texts by a parser "instance-tuples" and the tuples to which plausibility value are assigned "hypothesis-tuples".


See \[Sekine et al 1992\] 106 3.2 Terminology and notation instance-tuple \[h, r, a\] : a token of a dependency relation; part of the analysis of a sentence in a corpus.

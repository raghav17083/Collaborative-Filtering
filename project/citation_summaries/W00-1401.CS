Simple String Accuracy (SSA, Bangalore et al. 2000) has been proposed as a baseline evaluation metric for natural language generation. 
The generation task is to find a sentence e such that (1) e is a good sentence a priori, and (2) its meaning is the same as the input MR. For thelanguagemodel,weuseann-grammodel,which is remarkably useful in ranking candidate generated sentences (Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995; Bangalore et al. , 2000; Langkilde-Geary, 2002). 
Bangalore et al. describe some of the quantitative measures that have been used in (Bangalore et al. , 2000). 
It is unclear, however, what kind of metric would be most suitable for the evaluation of string realisations, so that, as a result, there have been a range of automatic metrics applied including inter alia exact match, string edit distance, NIST SSA, BLEU, NIST, ROUGE, generation string accuracy, generation tree accuracy, word accuracy (Bangalore et al., 2000; Callaway, 2003; Nakanishi et al., 2005; Velldal and Oepen, 2006; Belz and Reiter, 2006). 
The sentence planning stage is embodied by the SPoT sentence planner (Walker et al. , 2001), while the surface realization stage is embodied by the FERGUS surface realizer (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000).

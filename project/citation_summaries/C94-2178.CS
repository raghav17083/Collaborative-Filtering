 similarity-based: inspired by sentence alignment for multilingual parallel corpora in Machine Translation (Church, 1993; Fung and Church, 1994; Melamed, 1999), we view the alignment between sentences from summaries and sentences from nonsummaries as the alignment of monolingual parallel texts at the sentence level. 
Apart from single Word to single word translation such as Governor/~ and prosperity/~i~fl~, we also found many single word translations which show potential towards being translated as compound domain-specific terms such as follows:  finding Chinese words: Chinese texts do not have word boundaries such as space in English, therefore our text was tokenized into words by a statistical Chinese tokenizer (Fung & Wu 1994). 
Previous alignment methods we used such as Church (1993); Fung & Church (1994); Fung & McKeown (1994) would bin the anchor points into continuous blocks for a rough alignment. 
Numerous experiments have shown parallel bilingual corpora to provide a rich source of constraints for statistical analysis (e.g. , Brown et al. 1990; Gale & Church 1991 ; Gale et al. 1992; Church 1993; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan et al. 1993; Fung & Church 1994; Wu & Xia 1994; Fung & McKeown 1994). 
960 1.2 Alignment with Mixture Distribution Several papers have discussed the first issue, especially the problem of word alignments for bilingual corpora (Brown et al., 1993), (Dagan et al., 1993), (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993), (Fung and Church, 1994), (Vogel et al., 1996).

In the same spirit and facilitated by the release of the SemEval 2007 Task 18 data1, based on the Pilot Arabic Propbank, a preliminary SRL system exists for Arabic2 (Diab and Moschitti, 2007; Diab et al., 2007a). 
There is a widely held belief in the NLP and computational linguistics communities that identifying and defining roles of predicate arguments in a sentence has a lot of potential for and is a significant step toward improving important applications such as document retrieval, machine translation, question answering and information extraction (Moschitti et al., 2007). 
4.1 Experimental setup We use the dataset released in the SemEval 2007 Task 18 on Arabic Semantic Labeling (Diab et al., 2007a). 
The state-of-the-art in semantic role labelling has now advanced so much that a number of studies have shown that automatically inferred semantic argument structures can lead to tangible performance gains in NLP applications such as information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003), question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007) or recognising textual entailment (Burchardt and Frank, 2006). 
Identifying the semantic roles of the predicates in a text allows knowing who did what to whom when where how, etc. SRL has attracted much attention in recent years, as witnessed by several shared tasks in Senseval/SemEval (M`arquez et al., 2007; Litkowski, 2004; Baker et al., 2007; Diab et al., 2007), and CoNLL (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005; Surdeanu et al., 2008).

Garera and Yarowsky (2006) propose an unsupervised model which extracts hypernym relation for resloving definite NPs. 
Very interestingly, the distributional methods based on intra-sentence relations (Lin, 1998; Pado and Lapata, 2003) outperformed Garera and Yarowskys (2006) association measure when used for ranking, which may due to sparse data problems or simply too much noise for the latter. 
We also reimplemented the approach of Garera and Yarowsky (2006), who extract potential anaphor-antecedent pairs from unlabeled texts and rank these potentially related pairs by the mutual information statistic. 
However, while similarity measures (such as WordNet distance or Lins similarity metric) only detect cases of semantic similarity, association measures (such as the ones used by Poesio et al. , or by Garera and Yarowsky) also find cases of associative bridg497 Lin98 RFF TheY TheY:G2 PL03 Land (country/state/land) Staat Staat Kemalismus Regierung Kontinent state state Kemalism government continent Stadt Stadt Bauernfamilie Prasident Region city city agricultural family president region Region Landesregierung Bankgesellschaft Dollar Stadt region country government banking corporation dollar city Bundesrepublik Bundesregierung Baht Albanien Staat federal republic federal government Baht Albania state Republik Gewerkschaft Gasag Hauptstadt Bundesland republic trade union (a gas company) capital state Medikament (medical drug) Arzneimittel Pille RU Patient Arzneimittel pharmaceutical pill (a drug) patient pharmaceutical Praparat Droge Abtreibungspille Arzt Lebensmittel preparation drug (non-medical) abortion pill doctor foodstuff Pille Praparat Viagra Pille Praparat pill preparation Viagra pill preparation Hormon Pestizid Pharmakonzern Behandlung Behandlung hormone pesticide pharmaceutical company treatment treatment Lebensmittel Lebensmittel Praparat Abtreibungspille Arznei foodstuff foodstuff preparation abortion pill drug highest ranked words, with very rare words removed : RU 486, an abortifacient drug Lin98: Lins distributional similarity measure (Lin, 1998) RFF: Geffet and Dagans Relative Feature Focus measure (Geffet and Dagan, 2004) TheY: association measure introduced by Garera and Yarowsky (2006) TheY:G2: similar method using a log-likelihood-based statistic (see Dunning 1993) this statistic has a preference for higher-frequency terms PL03: semantic space association measure proposed by Pado and Lapata (2003) Table 1: Similarity and association measures: most similar items ing like 1a,b; the result of this can be seen in table (2): while the similarity measures (Lin98, RFF) list substitutable terms (which behave like synonyms in many contexts), the association measures (Garera and Yarowskys TheY measure, Pado and Lapatas association measure) also find non-compatible associations such as countrycapital or drugtreatment, which is why they are commonly called relationfree. 
In contrast to earlier investigations (Markert and Nissim, 2005; Garera and Yarowsky, 2006), we provide a more extensive overview on features and also discuss properties that influence their combinability.

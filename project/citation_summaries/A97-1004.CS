1 Introduction Conditional Maximum Entropy (maxent) models have been widely used for a variety of tasks, including language modeling (Rosenfeld, 1994), part-of-speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment, and parsing (Ratnaparkhi, 1998), word selection for machine translation (Berger et al. , 1996), and finding sentence boundaries (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997). 
(ii) Sentence splitting, using mxterminator (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997). 
We segment sentences with the help of MXTERMINATOR (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997). 
This is a difficult case even for sentence boundary disambiguation systerns ((Mikheev, 1998), (Palmer&Hearst, 1997) and (Reynar&Ratnaparkhi, 1997)) which are built for exactly that purpose, i.e., to decide whether a capitalized word which follows an abbreviation is attached to it or whether there is a sentence boundary between them.

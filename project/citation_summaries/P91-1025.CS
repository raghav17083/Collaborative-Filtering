Related Work Most computational work on near-synonymy has been motivated by lexical mismatches in machine translation (Kameyama et al. 1991). 
This built-in transcategoriality strongly facilitates applications such as interlingual MT, as it renders vacuous many problems connected with category mismatches (Kameyama et al. , 1991) and misalignments or divergences (Dorr, 1995), (Held, 1993) that plague those paradigms in MT which do not rely on extracting language-neutral text meaning representations. 
Formally, generalisation and specialisation can be done in various ways, as specified for instance in (Kameyama et al., 1991), (Poesio, 1996), (Mahesh et ah, 1997). 
6 Other works which have dealt with mismatches, e.g., (Dorr and Voss, 1998) with their interlingua and knowledge representations, (S5rasset, 1994) with his "interlingua acceptations", or (Kameyama, et al, 1991) with their infons, cannot account for eases which lie in between clear-cut cases of divergences and mismatches such as the example "se tenir" discussed in this paper. 
1.1 The Language Gap Problem Upon a close examination of empirical data, it is often difficult to classify a translation pair as a syntactic divergence (e.g., Dorr, 1990; Levin and Nirenburg, 1993), as in he limped up the stairs --~ il monta les marches en boitant (French) (he went up the stairs limping) or a semantic mismatch (e.g., Palmer and Zhibiao, 1995; Kameyama et al., 1991), as in lie, stand ~ se tenir (French).

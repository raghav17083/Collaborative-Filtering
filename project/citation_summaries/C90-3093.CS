While there is no prior work on generating textual descriptions of geo-referenced data, there have been studies on describing spatial data in the context of route directions ((Geldof, 2003), (Marciniak and Strube, 2004)), scene descriptions (Novak, 1986), geometric descriptions (Mitkov, 1990) and spatial descriptions (Ebert et al, 1996).

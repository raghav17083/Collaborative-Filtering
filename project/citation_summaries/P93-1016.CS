We used the dv package1 to compute type vectors from a Minipar (Lin, 1993) parse of the BNC. 
2 Throughout this article we use syntactic dependency relationships generated by the Minipar dependency parser (Lin 1993). 
parser in Lin and Goebel (1993). 
They were parsed with Minipar (Lin, 1993); named entities were computed using Heart of Gold (Callmeier et al. , 2004). 
We parse the BNC using MiniPar (Lin, 1993) and extract co-occurrence frequencies, considering only dependency relations for the most frequent 2000 verbs.

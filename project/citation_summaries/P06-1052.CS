This has been a very successful approach, but recent algorithms for eliminating subsets of readings have pushed the expressive power of these formalisms to their limits; for instance, Koller and Thater (2006) speculate that further improvements over their (incomplete) redundancy elimination algorithm require a more expressive formalism than dominance graphs. 
4 of Koller and Thater (2006) completely, whereas KT06 wont. To measure the extent to which the new algorithm improves upon KT06, we compare both algorithms on the USRs in the Rondane treebank (version of January 2006). 
(2) ax(az(P,Q),R)az(P,ax(Q,R)) Based on this definition, Koller and Thater (2006) present an algorithm (henceforth, KT06) that deletes rules from a dominance chart and thus removes subsets of readings from the USR. 
We use a slightly weaker version of the rewrite system that Koller and Thater (2006) used in their evaluation. 
One can then strengthen the underspecified description to efficiently eliminate subsets of readings that were not intended in the given context (Koller and Niehren, 2000; Koller and Thater, 2006); so when the individual readings are eventually computed, the number of remaining readings is much smaller and much closer to the actual perceived ambiguity of the sentence.

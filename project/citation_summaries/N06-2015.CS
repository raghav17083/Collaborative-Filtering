The OntoNotes (Pradhan et al., 2007a; Hovy et al., 2006) project has created a multilingual corpus of large-scale semantic annotations, including word senses, predicate-argument structure, ontology linking, and coreference 3 . In word sense creation, sense creators generate sense definitions by grouping fine-grained sense distinctions obtained from WordNet and dictionaries into more coarse-grained senses. 
3 Experimental Results The data we used for our experiments are developed as part of the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al. , 2006) and they come from a variety of sources. 
For instance, in the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al. , 2006) senses are grouped until a 90% inter-annotator agreement is achieved. 
Overall, however, this data indicates that the approach suggested by (Palmer, 2000) and that is being adopted in the ongoing OntoNotes project (Hovy et al. , 2006) does result in higher system performance. 
WordNet 2.1 is used as the sense inventory for most of the target words, but certain words have one or more senses from OntoNotes (Hovy et al. , 2006).

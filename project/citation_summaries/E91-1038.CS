Future research should investigate questions such as whether there are structural constraints on coherence graphs (e.g. , as proposed by Danlos [2004]) or whether there are systematic structural differences between the coherence graphs of texts that belong to different genres (e.g. , as proposed by Bergler [1991]). 
TM We find that this type of metonymic extension for the subject is natural and indeed very frequent with reporting verbs Bergler (1991), such as announce, report, release, and claim, while it is in general not possible with other verbs selecting human subjects, e.g., the verbs of contemplation (such as contemplate, consider, and think). 
To test whether the intuitions supported by the above data could be confirmed in corpora, Bergler (1991) derived the statistical co-occurrence of insist with discourse polarity markers in the 7 million-word corpus of Wall Street Journal articles. 
3 Other accounts assume less constrained graphs that allow crossed dependencies as well as nodes with multiple parents (e.g. , Bergler 1991; Birnbaum 1982; Danlos 2004; Hobbs 1985; McKeown 1985; Reichman 1985; Zukerman and McConachy 1995; for dialogue structure, Penstein Rose et al. 1995). 
In a careful study of seven reporting verbs on a 250,000-word corpus of Time magazine articles from 1963, we found that the preference for different metonymic extensions varies considerably within this field (Bergler 1991).

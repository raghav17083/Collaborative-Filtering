A hybrid rule learning approach to classification involving both statistical and symbolic features has been shown to perform better than LSA and Naive Bayes classification (McCallum and Nigam, 1998) for content analysis in the physics domain (Rose et al. , 2003). 
Information Extraction for Short Answers In our initial experiments, we adopted an Information Extraction approach (see also Mitchell et al. 2003). 
The problem of providing reliable, detailed, content-based feedback to students is a more difficult problem, however, that involves identifying individual pieces of content (Christie, 2003), sometimes called answer aspects (Wiemer-Hastings et al. , 1998). 
While straightforward applications of bag of words approaches such as LSA have performed successfully on the content analysis task in domains such as Computer Literacy (WiemerHastings et al. , 1998), they have been demonstrated to perform poorly in causal domains such as research methods (Malatesta et al. , 2002) and physics (Rose et al. , 2003) because they base their predictions only on the words included in a text and not on the functional relationships between them. 
There is also a small, but growing, body of research in the area of scoring free-text responses to short answer questions (e.g. , Callear et al. , 2001; Leacock, 2004; Mitchell et al. , 2003; Pullman, 2005; Sukkarieh, 2005).

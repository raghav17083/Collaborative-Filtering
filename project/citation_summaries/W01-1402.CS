The proposed approach is inspired by examplebased machine translation (EBMT; Nagao, 1984; Sato and Nagao, 1990; Maruyama and Watanabe, 1992) and is similar to the recent works of (Meyers et al. , 1998) and (Richardson et al. , 2001) where transfer rules are also derived after aligning the source and target nodes of corresponding parses. 
Statistical MT systems have relied on bi-texts to automatically create word-alignments; in many statistical MT systems however, the authors state that use of a conventional bilingual dictionary enhances the performance of the system (Al-Onaizan et al. 1999, Koehn & Knight 2001). 
The Spanish-English version of MSR-MT has been described in Richardson et al. 2001a, Richardson et al 2001b, and the reader is referred to these papers for more information concerning algorithms employed during phrase alignment. 
Our overall approach to machine translation is a deep-transfer approach in which the transfer relationships are learned from a parallel bilingual corpus (Richardson et al. , 2001). 
The architecture of the MT system as described elsewhere (Richardson et al. 2001) used both a traditional bilingual dictionary and an automatically derived word-association file at training time, but it used only the traditional bilingual dictionary at runtime.

Segment alignment In a recent paper, Covington (1996) described an algorithm for aligning historical cognates. 
It is based on Covingtons algorithm (Covington, 1996). 
In this paper I extend the guided-search alignment algorithm of Covington (Computational Linguistics, 1996) to handle more than two strings. 
Algorithms for aligning pairs of words have been proposed by Covington (1996) and Kondrak (2000). 
3 Applying an evaluation metric The phonetic similarity criterion used by Covington (1996) is shown in Table 1.

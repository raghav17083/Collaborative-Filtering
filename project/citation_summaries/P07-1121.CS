1 Introduction Recent work (Wong and Mooney, 2007; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; He and Young, 2006) has developed learning algorithms for the problem of mapping sentences to their underlying semantic representations. 
This was pursued further, for instance, by Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005) and Wong and Mooney (2007), aimed at learning log-linear models, or (in the latter case) synchronous CF grammars augmented with lambdaoperators,formappingEnglishqueriesto DB queries. 
Some other semantic parser learning systems which need MRL in the form of Prolog (Tang andMooney,2001)or-calculus(Zettlemoyerand Collins, 2007; Wong and Mooney, 2007) do not use productions of the MRG but instead use predicates of the MRL. 
1 Introduction Recently, researchers have developed algorithms that learn to map natural language sentences to representations of their underlying meaning (He and Young, 2006; Wong and Mooney, 2007; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005).

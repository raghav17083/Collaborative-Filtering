We startwith the proposalof Shieberand Schabes (1990), which used multi-component TAG for the semantic portion of a synchronous TAG. 
At the same time, grammar theoreticians have proposed various generative synchronous grammar formalisms for MT, such as Synchronous Context Free Grammars (S-CFG) (Wu, 1997) or Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars (S-TAG) (Shieber and Schabes, 1990). 
The synchronous grammar approach, originally due to Shieber and Schabes (1990), supposes that T2 is generated in lockstep to T1.1 When choosing how to expand a certain VP node in T2, a synchronous CFG process would observe that this node is aligned to a node VPprime in T1, which had been expanded in T1 by VPprime  NPprime Vprime. 
Synchronous TAG (Shieber, 1994; Shieber and Schabes, 1990) extends TAG by taking the elementary structures to be pairs of TAG trees with links between particular nodes in those trees. 
Once a grammar has been used to express structural relationships, in many applications there are operations which act at a 'meta level' on the structures expressed by the grammar: for example, lifting rules on a dependency grammar to achieve pseudo-projectivity (Kahane et al, 1998), and mapping between synchronised Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) (Shieber and Schabes, 1990; Shieber 1994) as in machine translation or syntax-to-semantics transfer.

Berwick and Weinberg (1982) point out that, since the complexity of parsing algorithms is generally at least linearly dependent on the size of the grammar, this requirement may make CKY less than optimal for parsing short sentences. 
(See Berwick (1982), Berwick and Weinberg (1982, 1984), and Ristad (1985) for further discussion). 
Some consequences of this demonstration Berwick\[1982) provides a similarly semi-formal proof of the NP-hardness of parsing with respect to lexical-functional grammar, a formalism with many similarities to FU grammar, although his proof is radically different from the scheme presented here for FU grammar. 
(See Berwick (1982), Berwick and Weinberg (1984), aJad Ristad (1985) for further discussion). 
Berwick and Weinberg (1982) argue that the effects of grammar size can actually dominate complexity for a relevant range of input lengths.

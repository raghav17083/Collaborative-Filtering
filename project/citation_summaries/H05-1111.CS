This task is fundamentally syntactic in nature and complements the task of assigning thematic role labels (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002; Nielsen and Pradhan 2004; Xue and Palmer 2004; Swier and Stevenson 2005). 
Swier and Stevenson (2005) and Yi et al. 
VN classes were proven beneficial for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) (Swier and Stevenson, 2005), Semantic Parsing (Shi and Mihalcea, 2005) and building conceptual graphs (Hensman and Dunnion, 2004). 
Swier and Stevenson (2004) and Swier and Stevenson (2005) presented the first model that does not use an SRL annotated corpus. 
Given the variability in the sets of roles used across the computational resources, an important issue is the extent to which different role sets affect the SRL task, as well as subsequent use of the output in other NLP applications.Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) initiated this type of investigation by exploring whether their results were dependent on the set of semantic roles they used.To this end, they mapped the FrameNet frame elements into a set of abstract thematic roles (i.e., more general roles such as Agent, Theme, Location), and concluded that their system could use these thematic roles 149 Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 2 without degradation.Similar questions must be investigated in the context of PropBank, where the framesets for the verbs may have signicant domain-specic meanings and arguments due to the dependence of the project on WSJ data.Given the uncertainty in the linguistic status of semantic role lists, and the lack of evidence about which types of roles would be most useful in various NLP tasks, an important ongoing focus of attention is the value of mapping between the role sets of the different resources (Swier and Stevenson 2005; Loper, Yi, and Palmer 2007; Yi, Loper, and Palmer 2007).

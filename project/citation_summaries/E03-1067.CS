This is also true for metaphors about deepest recesses of the mind (in RTE-1 dataset), etc. This type of open-ended metaphors have been subjected to a in-depth analysis (both formal and computational) within the ATT-Meta system and approach for metaphor interpretation (Agerri et al., 2007; Barnden et al., 2003). 
ing of rattlesnake is not listed in WordNet whereas the meat reading for chicken is. As there is no common framework or corpus for figurative language resolution, previous computational works (Fass, 1997; Hobbs et al. , 1993; Barnden et al. , 2003, among others) carry out only smallscale evaluations. 
These known mappings may be constituents of particular metaphorical view, but previous work (Barnden et al. , 2003; Wallington et al. , 2006) has 109 shown evidence that there are metaphorical aspects (such as causal relations between events) that, subject to being called, invariantly map from source to target (we call these mappings View-Neutral Mapping Adjuncts or VNMAs) irrespective of whatever specific metaphorical views are in play. 
The basis for such translation is View-Neutral Mapping Adjuncts, a special type of mappings that cover the shape of eventsand processes, temporalpropertiesand relationships,causation,functioning, mental states, emotional states, value judgments and various other matters (Agerri et al., 2007; Barnden et al., 2003). 
Generally, in metaphor understanding research, a specialized system has been fed a relatively small number of metaphorical inputs, and the correct outputs have been dictated by the researcher, (e.g. Fass, 1997; Falkenhainer et al., 1989; Martin, 1990; Barnden et al., 2003).

Justeson and Katz (1991) demonstrated the co-occurrence hypothesis for 35 prototypical antonym pairs (from an original set of 39 antonym pairs compiled by Deese (1965)) and also for an additional 22 frequent antonym pairs. 
In addition, we are exploring tests for determining whether two adjectives are antonymous, essentially in the opposite direction of the work by Justeson and Katz (1991), and tests for comparing the relative semantic strength of two adjectives. 
The Deese antonyms (Deese, 1964) is the prototypical collection of pairs of antonymous adjectives that have been used for similar analyses in the past (Deese, 1964; Justeson and Katz, 1991; Grefenstette, 1992). 
This, along with the distributional hypothesis of antonyms, and the findings by Justeson and Katz (1991) (antonymous concepts tend to occur more often than chance in the same sentence), suggests that if we find a word pair in a sentence such that two of its senses are strongly contrasting (as per the algorithm described in Section 7.2.2), then it is probable that the two words are used in those contrasting senses. 
Justeson and Katz (1991) later showed that in sentences that contain both members of an antonymous adjective pair, the target adjectives do indeed occur in similar syntactic structures at the phrasal level.

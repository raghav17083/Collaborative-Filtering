343 Poesio et al. Centering: A Parametric Theory However, it has been suggested in recent work that especially in dialogue, they may actually realize CFs (Byron and Stent 1998). 
The Data The aim of our project, which is called GNOME and whose home page is at http://www.hcrc.ed.ac.uk/ DI gnome, is to develop NP generation algorithms whose generality is to be verified by incorporating them in two distinct systems: the ILEX system developed at the University of Edinburgh, that generates Web pages describing museum objects on the basis of the perceived status of its users knowledge and of the objects she previously looked at (Oberlander et al. , 1998); and the ICONOCLAST system, developed at the University of Brighton, that supports the creation of patient information leaflets (Scott et al. , 1998). 
Our instructions for this attribute are derived from those used in the FRAMENET project ((Baker et al. , 1998); see also http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/framenet/). 
Most researchers working on centering, including Grosz et al. , assume that several factors play a role in determining the relative ranking of forwardlooking centers; in fact, Walker, Iida, and Cote (1994) and Walker, Joshi, and Prince (1998a) claim that the factors affecting ranking may not be the same in all languages. 
ILEX generates Web pages describing museum objects on the basis of the perceived status of its users knowledge and of the objects she has previously looked at (Oberlander et al. 1998) The SOLE project ILEX with concept-to-speech abilities, using linguistic information to control intonation (Hitzeman et al. 1998).

The source texts were then run through Brill's part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1993c), and, as a baseline heuristic, chunk structure tags were assigned to each word based on its part-of-speech tag. 
The part-of-speech tags used by this baseline heuristic, and then later also matched against by transformational rule patterns, were derived by running the raw texts in a prepass through Brill's transformational part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1993c). 
Brill(1993a) proposed a transformation-based error.driven automatic learning method, which has been used in part-ofspeech(POS) tagging\[Bri92\], text chunking\[RM95\] and sentence bracketing\[Bri93b\]. 
1; they closely replicate Brill's results (1993b, page 96), allowing for the fact that his tests used more templates, including templates like "if one of the three previous tags is A". 
In this paper, we target a somewhat higher level of chunk structure using Brill's (1993b) transformation-based learning mechanism, in which a sequence of transformational rules is learned from a corpus; this sequence iteratively improves upon a baseline model for some interpretive feature of the text.

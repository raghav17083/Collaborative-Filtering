To date, most research has addressed the problem of MWE type classification for VNC expressions in English (Melamed, 1997; Lin, 1999; Baldwin et al., 2003; na Villada Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006; Fazly and Stevenson, 2007; Van de Cruys and Villada Moiron, 2007; McCarthy et al., 2007), not token classification. 
Approaches evaluated so far make use of dictionaries with semantic annotation (Piao et al. , 2006), WordNet (Pearce, 2001), automatically generated thesauri (Lin, 1999; McCarthy et al. , 2003; Fazly and Stevenson, 2006), vector-based methods that measure semantic distance (Baldwin et al. , 2003; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006), translations extracted from parallel corpora (Villada Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006) or hybrid methods that use machine learning techniques informed by features coded using some of the above methods (Venkatapathy and Joshi, 2005). 
Most progress has been made especially in the field of multiword identification (Villada Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Zhang et al. , 2006). 
Many researchers have recently developed methods for the automatic acquisition of various properties of MWEs from corpora (Lin, 1999; Krenn and Evert, 2001; Baldwin et al. , 2003; McCarthy et al. , 2003; Venkatapathy and Joshi, 2005; Villada Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006; Fazly and Stevenson, 2006). 
1 Introduction Identifying non-compositional (or idiomatic) multi-word expressions (MWEs) is an important subtask for any computational system (Sag et al. , 2002), and significant attention has been paid to practical methods for solving this problem in recent years (Lin, 1999; Baldwin et al. , 2003; Villada Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006).

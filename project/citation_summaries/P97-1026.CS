The resulting approach is related to [Stone and Doran, 1997; Cassell et al. , 2000]. 
In the last decade, LTAG has been used in several aspects of natural language understanding (e.g. , parsing (Schabes, 1990; Srinivas, 1997), semantics (Joshi and Vijay-Shanker, 1999; Kallmeyer and Joshi, 1999), and discourse (Webber and Joshi, 1998)) and a number of NLP applications (e.g. , machine translation (Palmer et al. , 1998), information retrieval (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997), and generation (Stone and Doran, 1997; McCoy et al. , 1992). 
The process of extension simply consists of deriving a more elaborate form with a richer meaning using the generator's linguistic resources--it is useful to think of obtaining this by carrying out a step of derivation in a lexicalized grammar (Stone and Doran, 1997)--and then consulting the model of the context to obtain an updated interpretation. 
Our approach is fundamentally di#0Berent from systems that reason directly about syntax and build realizations by syntactic rank #28#28Bateman, 1997#29, #28Elhadad et al. , 1997#29; #28Nicolov et al. , 1995#29; #28Stone and Doran, 1997#29#29. 
It has been used in many NLP applications such as generation (Stone and Doran, 1997).

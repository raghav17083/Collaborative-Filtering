The English Hindi data were provided by Niraj Aswani and Robert Gaizauskas from University of Sheffield (Aswani and Gaizauskas, 2005b).


Given numerous (constructive) debates held during the previous word alignment evaluation, which questioned the informativeness of the NULL alignment evaluations, we decided 67 Team System name Description Carnegie Mellon University SPA (Brown et al. , 2005) Information Sciences Institute / USC ISI (Fraser and Marcu, 2005) Johns Hopkins University JHU (Schafer and Drabek, 2005) Microsoft Research MSR (Moore, 2005) Romanian Academy Institute of Artificial Intelligence TREQ-AL, MEBA, COWAL (Tufis et al. , 2005) University of Maryland / UMIACS UMIACS (Lopez and Resnik, 2005) University of Sheffield Sheffield (Aswani and Gaizauskas, 2005a) University of Montreal JAPA, NUKTI (Langlais et al. , 2005) University of Sao Paulo, University of Alicante LIHLA (Caseli et al. , 2005) University Jaume I MAR (Vilar, 2005) Table 1: Teams participating in the word alignment shared task to evaluate only no-NULL alignments, and thus the NULL alignments were removed from both submissions and gold standard data.


For the subtask of unlimited resources, Aswani and Gaizauskas (2005) used a multi-feature approach for many-to-many word alignment on English-Hindi parallel corpora.


For the subtask of unlimited resources, some researchers (Aswani and Gaizauskas, 2005; Lopez and Resnik, 2005; Tufis et al. , 2005) used language-dependent resources such as dictionary, thesaurus, and dependency parser to improve word alignment results.

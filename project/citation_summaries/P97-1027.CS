1 Introduction The generation of referring expressions is one of the most common tasks in natural language generation, and has been addressed by many researchers in the past two decades (including Appelt 1985, Dale 1992, Reiter 1990, Dale & Haddock 1991, Dale & Reiter 1995, Horacek 1997, Stone & Webber 1998, Krahmer & Theune 1999 and van Deemter 2000). 
There may, however, be certain dependencies between content selection and realization (see, e.g., Horacek [1997] and Krahmer and Theune [2002]). 
Some of the associated problems and a proposal to systematically incorporate this mapping are described in (Horacek, 1997). 
In order to refer to an intended object (the target) among others (distractors), most past work (Appelt, 1985; Dale and Haddock, 1991; Dale, 1992; Dale and Reiter, 1995; Heeman and Hirst, 1995; Horacek, 1997; Krahmer and Theune, 2002; van Deemter, 2002; Krahmer et al. , 2003) utilized attributes of the target and binary relations between the target and distractors.

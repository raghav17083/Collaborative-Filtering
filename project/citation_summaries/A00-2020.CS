Some probabilistic approaches for corpus error detection have also been studied (Eskin, 2000; Murata et al. , 2000).


(2000) detected errors of morphemes in a corpus with a precision of 7080%, and Eskin (2000) detected errors with a precision of 69%, but our approach achieved more than 80%.


Eskin (2000) conducted corpus error detection using anomaly detection.

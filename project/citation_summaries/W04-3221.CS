To demonstrate the usefulness of stereotype-based concept descriptions, we replicate here the clustering experiments of Almuhareb and Poesio (2004, 2005), who in turn demonstrated that conceptual features that are mined from specific textual patterns can be used to construct WordNet-like ontological structures. 
2.1 Episodic Logic Automatically acquiring general world knowledge from text is not a task that provides an immediate solution to any real world problem.2 Rather, the motivation for acquiring large stores of background knowledge is to enable research within other areas of artificial intelligence, e.g., the construction of systems that can engage in dialogues about everyday topics in unrestricted English, use 1Almuhareb and Poesio (2004) treat unary attributes as values of binary attributes; e.g., illegal might be the value of a legality attribute. 
In previous work (Almuhareb and Poesio, 2004) we used this same approach to extract attributes, using the pattern the * of the C [is|was] (suggested by, e.g., (Woods, 1975) as a test for attributehood) to search for attributes of concept C in the Web, using the Google API. 
Almuhareb and Poesio (2004) used as their experimental basis a sampling of 214 English nouns from 13 of WordNets upper-level semantic categories, and proceeded to harvest adjectival features for these noun-concepts from the web using the textual pattern [a|an|the] * C [is|was].

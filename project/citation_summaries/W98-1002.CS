Maloney and Niv (1998) developed TAGARAB an Arabic name recognizer that uses a patternrecognition engine integrated with morphological analysis.


To improve this performance, we plan to enrich the Arabic lexicon with more proper names, using either name recognition (Maloney and Niv, 1998) or a back translation approach after name recognition in English texts (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002).

A well known architectural scheme outlining the three basic levels of an NLG system has been proposed by Reiter (Reiter, 1994, p.164) 1: 1. 
2.2 Rule 2 Applied to Generation Reiter (1994) claimed that existing generation systems converged on a "consensus," generic natural language generation (NLG) architecture consisting of the following tasks:  Content determination/text planning: deciding the content of a message and organizing the component propositions into a text tree;  Sentence planning: aggregating propositions into clausal units and choosing lexical items corresponding to concepts in the knowledge base, including referring expressions;  Linguistic realization: taking care of surface details such as agreement and orthography. 
A prominent example of this second case is the consensus pipeline architecture recognized by [Reiter, 1994] and further elaborated in [Reiter and Dale, 2000]. 
While many systems allow for interaction across these components, there is general consensus that these two components can be separated (Reiter 1994). 
Reiter (1994) proposed an analysis of such systems in terms of a simple three stage pipeline.

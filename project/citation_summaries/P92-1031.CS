Due to the difficulty of the problem, several authors have devised techniques for underspecified logical representations that can efficiently store multiple ambiguous readings, and they devise techniques for automated reasoning using underspecified representations (Reyle, 1995; Latecki, 1992; Poesio, 1993b).

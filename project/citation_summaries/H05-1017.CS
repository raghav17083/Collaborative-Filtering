We therefore measure the contextual similarity between a category c and a document d utilizing LSA space, replicating the method in (Gliozzo et al., 2005): vectorccon and vectordLSA are taken as the LSA vectors of the category name and the document, respectively, yielding Simcon(c,d) = cos(vectorccon, vectordLSA)).2 The overall similarity score of step 3 is defined as Sim(c,d) = Simref(c,d)  Simcon(c,d). 
As described in Section 1, the keyword list in (Gliozzo et al., 2005) consisted of the category name alone. 
We thus extend the scheme in Figure 1 by creating two vectors per category (in steps 1 and 2): a reference vector vectorcref in term space, consisting of referring terms for the category name; and a context vector vectorccon, representing the category name in LSA space, as in (Gliozzo et al., 2005). 
(Gliozzo et al., 2005) succeeded eliminating this requirement by using the category name alone as the initial keyword, yet obtaining superior performance within the keywordbased approach. 
When analyzing the behavior of the LSA representation of (Gliozzo et al., 2005) we noticed that it captures two types of similarities between the category name and document terms.

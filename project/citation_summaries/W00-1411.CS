As already mentioned, information from centering theory was used in text generation to select the most coherent text from several candidates (Kibble and Power, 2000; Karamanis and Manurung, 2002). 
This suggests that for some of the texts the continuity principle is too weak to influence the quality of a summary, and a combination of the continuity principle with the other principles from centering theory, as already used for text generation in (Kibble and Power, 2000), could lead to better summaries. 
M.KP sums up the nocbs and the violations of cheapness, coherence and salience, preferring the ordering with the lowest total cost (Kibble and Power, 2000). 
Kibble and Power [Kibble and Power, 2000] propose a system which uses Centering Theory [Walker et al. , 1998] for planning of coherent texts and choice of referring expressions. 
Ideas from centering, and in particular Rule 2, are increasingly found useful in text planning (McKeown 1985; Kibble and Power 2000; Knott et al. 2001; Karamanis 2003).

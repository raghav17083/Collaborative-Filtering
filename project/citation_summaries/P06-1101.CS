1510 5 Related Work In recent years, many research has been done on extracting relations from free text (e.g., (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Snow et al., 2006)); however, almost all of them require some language-dependent parsers or taggers for English, which restrict the language of their extractions to English only (or languages that have these parsers). 
3.4) 3.1 Probabilistic model In the probabilistic formulation (Snow et al., 2006), the task of learning taxonomies from a corpus is seen as a probability maximization problem. 
We have adopted the evaluation method of Snow et al (2006): compare the generated hypernyms with hypernyms present in a lexical resource, in our case the Dutch part of EuroWordNet (1998). 
4.1 Judging Rule Correctness Following the spirit of the fine-grained human evaluation in (Snow et al., 2006), we randomly sampled 800 rules from our rule-base and presented them to an annotator who judged them for correctness, according to the lexical reference notion specified above. 
6 Related Work A large body of previous work exists on extending WORDNET with additional concepts and instances (Snow et al., 2006; Suchanek et al., 2007); these methods do not address attributes directly.

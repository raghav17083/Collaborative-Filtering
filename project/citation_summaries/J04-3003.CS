This approach, however, precludes using the corpus to compare possible definitions of utterance, one of the goals of the GNOME annotation (Poesio et al. , 2004b). 
More recently, the corpus has also been used to develop and evaluate anaphora resolution systems, with a special focus on the resolution of bridging references (Poesio, 2003; Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov, 2004; Poesio et al. , 2004a) Although the results of the studies using the GNOME corpus mentioned above have been published in a number of papers, and although a detailed annotation manual was written and has been available on the Web for a few years (Poesio, 2000b), none of the previously published papers discusses in detail the goals of the annotation and the methodology that was followed, especially for the non-anaphoric aspects. 
The GNOME corpus has been used to study salience, particularly as formalized in Centering theory (Poesio et al. , 2004c), to develop statistical models of natural language generation (e.g. , (Poesio, 2000a; Henschel et al. , 2000; Cheng et al. , 2001; Cheng, 2001; Karamanis, 2003)) and to evaluate anaphora resolution systems, with a special focus on the resolution of bridging references (Poesio, 2003; Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov, 2004; Poesio et al. , 2004b). 
This definition of utterance is not optimal from the point of view of minimizing Centering violations (Poesio et al. , 2004), but in this way most utterances are the realization of a single proposition; i.e., the impact of aggregation is greatly reduced. 
A version of GUITAR without the DN detection aspects of the Vieira / Poesio algorithm was evaluated on the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2000; Poesio et al. , 2004), which contains 554 definite descriptions, of which 180 anaphoric, and 305 third-person pronouns, of which 217 anaphoric.

We introduced a different type of constraint, graded conslraints, inspired by the concept of graded unification discussed it, (Kim, 1994).


While we know of previous work which associates scores with feature structures (Kim, 1994) are not aware of any previous treatment which makes explicit the link to classical probability theory.

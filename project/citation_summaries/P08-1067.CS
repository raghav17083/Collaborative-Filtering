2) Employ the forest-based tree rule extraction algorithm (Mi and Huang, 2008) to extract our rules from the non-complete forest. 
An example of a method to mitigate this shortcoming is the forest reranking by Huang (2008), in which complex features are evaluated as early as possible. 
Performance with Charniak parser enhanced by re-ranking plus self-training 5.7 Comparison with Other State-of-the-art Results Table 11 and table 12 compare our method with the other state-of-the-art methods; we use I, B, R, S and C to denote individual model (Charniak 2000; Collins 2000; Bod 2003; Petrov and Klein 2007), bilingual-constrained model (Burkett and Klein 2008) 1 , re-ranking model (Charniak and Johnson 2005, Huang 2008), self-training model (David McClosky 2006) and combination model (Sagae and Lavie 2006) respectively. 
For parse forest pruning (Mi et al., 2008), we utilize the Margin-based pruning algorithm presented in (Huang, 2008). 
This latter work was then further improved by Huang (2008) to 91.7%, by utilizing the benefit of forest structure.

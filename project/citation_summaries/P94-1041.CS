As illustrated in Figure 6, word correspondences for speech repairs tend to exhibit a cross serial dependency (Heeman and Allen 1994); in other words, if we have a correspondence between Wj in the reparandum and Wk in the alteration, any correspondence with a word in the alteration after Wk will be to a word that is after wj. 
In (Bear 1994) relied tween analyzing and identifying self repairs, et al., 1992) and (Heeman and Allen, found that the most effective methods on identifying shared textual regions bethe reparandum and the repair. 
Since speech repairs are often accompanied by word correspondences (Levelt 1983; Hindle 1983; Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg 1992; Heeman and Allen 1994; Kikui and Morimoto 1994), the actual reparandum will better predict the words in the alteration of the repair. 
Heeman and Allen (1994) present an algorithm that detects and corrects modification and abridged repairs. 
Probably the most widely used is the presence of word correspondences between the reparandum and alteration, both at the word level and at the level of syntactic constituents (Levelt 1983; Hindle 1983; Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg 1992; Heeman and Allen 1994; Kikui and Morimoto 1994).

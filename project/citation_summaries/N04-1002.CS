Most previous work (Bagga & Baldwin, 1998; Mann & Yarowsky, 2003; Li et al. , 2004; Gooi & Allan, 2004; Malin, 2005; Pedersen et al. , 2005; Byung-Won On and Dongwon Lee, 2007) employed unsupervised methods because no large annotated corpus is available and because of the variety of the data distributions for different ambiguous personal names.

In particular, we seek to go beyond the kind of bag of local words features employed in earlier systems (Bagga & Baldwin, 1998; Gooi & Allan, 2004; Pedersen et al. , 2005) that did not attempt to exploit deep semantic features that are difficult to extract, and to go beyond the kind of biographical information (Mann & Yarowsky, 2003) that is unlikely to occur with great frequency (such as place of birth, or family relationships) in many of the documents returned by typical search engines. 
(Gooi and Allan, 2004) simplified this approach by eliminating the WDC module without significant deterioration in performance. 
Chung and Allan (2004) have worked on cross-document co-referencing using large scale corpus, where they have said ambiguous names from the same domain (here for example, politics) are harder to disambiguate when compared to names from different domains.

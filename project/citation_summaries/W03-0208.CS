SELSA (Kanejiya et al., 2003) is a system that attempts to add context to LSA by supplementing the feature vectors with some simple syntactical features, namely the part-of-speech of the previous word.


POS tags dont help LSA either, as has already been observed by (Wiemer-Hastings, 2001; Kanejiya et al. , 2003) for other tasks.

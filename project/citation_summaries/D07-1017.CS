An extension of DIRT, named LEDIR, has also been proposed (Bhagat et al., 2007) to recognize directional textual entailment rules (e.g., Y was written by X  Y is the work of X). 
Recent approaches using distributional similarity methods for the induction of selectional preferences are the ones by Erk (2007), Bhagat et al. 
Despite the need for directional similarity measures, their investigation counts, to the best of our knowledge, only few works (Weeds and Weir, 2003; Geffet and Dagan, 2005; Bhagat et al., 2007; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008; Michelbacher et al., 2007) and is utterly lacking. 
With 850 Precision(l,r) we obtain a soft version of the inclusion hypothesis presented in (Geffet and Dagan, 2005), which expects l to entail r if the important features of l appear also in r. Similarly, the LEDIR algorithm (Bhagat et al., 2007) identifies the entailment direction between two binary templates, l and r, which participate in a relation learned by (the symmetric) DIRT, by measuring the proportion of instantiations of l that are covered by the instantiations of r. As far as we know, only (Shinyama et al., 2002) and (Pekar, 2006) learn rules between unary templates. 
These figures correspond to substantial agreement (Landis and Koch, 1997) and are comparable with related semantic annotations (Szpektor et al., 2007; Bhagat et al., 2007).

There are other successful semi-supervised training approaches for dependency parsing, such as (Koo et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008), and it would be interesting to investigate how they could be applied to constituency parsing. 
The first is usually focus on exploiting automatic generated labeled data from the unlabeled data (Steedman et al., 2003; McClosky et al., 2006; Reichart and Rappoport, 2007; Sagae and Tsujii, 2007; Chen et al., 2008), the second is on combining supervised and unsupervised methods, and only unlabeled data are considered (Smith and Eisner, 2006; Wang and Schuurmans, 2008; Koo et al., 2008). 
There has been a lot of progress in learning dependency tree parsers (McDonald et al., 2005; Koo et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008). 
It is often straightforward to obtain large amounts of unlabeled data, making semi-supervised approaches appealing; previous work on semisupervised methods for dependency parsing includes (Smith and Eisner, 2007; Koo et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008). 
Research in the field of unsupervised and weakly supervised parsing ranges from various forms of EM training (Pereira and Schabes, 1992; Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2005) over bootstrapping approaches like selftraining (McClosky et al., 2006) to feature-based enhancements of discriminative reranking models (Koo et al., 2008) and the application of semisupervised SVMs (Wang et al., 2008).

The string operations generalize the not;ion or c,,nsl, rainl, found in (Carpenter 1992) along lines suggested by l~eape (1991); such operations were coded by functional and relational constraints by Bird and Klein (1993) and by Mastroianni (1993). 
In this section we give an overview of this automaton model and briefly outline the view of automata as types that was originally proposed in Bird (1992). 
We approach these challenges by adopting a formal, nonprocedural, nonlinear model of phonology and showing how it can be integrated into HPSG, following on the heels of recent work by the authors (Bird and Klein 1990; Bird 1992; Klein 1992). 
Multidimensional phonological structures were taken to be descriptions of classes of phonetic objects, following Wheeler (1981), Bird and Klein (1990), Pierrehumbert (1990), Bird (1990), and Coleman (1992). 
Moreover, some recent thinking on the phonology-phonetics interface supports this view (Pierrehumbert 1990; Coleman 2 (Bach and Wheeler 1981; Wheeler 1981; Bird 1990; Cahill 1990; Coleman 1991; Scobbie 1991; Bird 1992; Walther 1992; Mastroianni 1993; Russell 1993) 456 Steven Bird and Ewan Klein Phonological Analysis in Typed Feature Systems 1992).

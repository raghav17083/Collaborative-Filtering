P08-1076:1	29:228	As our approach for incorporating unlabeled data, we basically follow the idea proposed in (Suzuki et al., 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
P08-1076:2	59:228	Following this idea, there have been introduced a parameter estimation approach for non-generative approaches that can effectively incorporate unlabeled data (Suzuki et al., 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
P08-1076:3	86:228	Surprisingly, although JESS-CM is a simpler version of the hybrid model in terms of model structure and parameter estimation procedure, JESS-CM provides F-scores of 94.45 and 88.03 for CoNLL00 and 03 data, respectively, which are 0.15 and 0.83 points higher than those reported in (Suzuki et al., 2007) for the same configurations.
---------------------------------------------------
P08-1076:4	83:228	As a solution, a given amount of labeled training data is divided into two distinct sets, i.e., 4/5 for estimating , and the 667 remaining 1/5 for estimating  (Suzuki et al., 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
P08-1076:5	79:228	In addition, the calculation cost for estimating parameters of embedded joint PMs (HMMs) is independent of the number of HMMs, J, that we used (Suzuki et al., 2007).

P08-1076:6	81:228	2.4 Comparison with Hybrid Model SSL based on a hybrid generative/discriminative approach proposed in (Suzuki et al., 2007) has been defined as a log-linear model that discriminatively combines several discriminative models, pDi , and generative models, pGj , such that: R(y|x;,,) = producttext i p Di (y|x;i)i producttext j p Gj (xj,y;j)j summationtext y producttext i p Di (y|x;i)i producttext j p Gj (xj,y;j)j , where ={i}Ii=1, and ={{i}Ii=1,{j}I+Jj=I+1}.

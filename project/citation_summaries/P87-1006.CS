Socalled ill-formed input (fragmentary sentences, ellipsis etc) is very frequent, but the use of pronouns seems limited (Guindon, et al, 1987, J0nsson and Dahlb/~ck, 11988).


The language used has been described as 'formal' (Grosz, 1977), 'telegraphic' (Guindon et al, 1987), or 'computerese' (Reilly, 1987).


With some caution, bowever, perhaps the following can be accepted as a summary of the pattem of results obtained so far: The syntactic structure is not too complex (Guindon et al, 1987, Reilly, 1987), and presumably within the capacity of current parsing technology.


Similar results were found by Guindon et al (1987), where only 3% of the utterances contained any pronouns.

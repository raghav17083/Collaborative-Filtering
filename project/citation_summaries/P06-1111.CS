When comparing to previous work that used manually annotated corpora in its evaluation (Haghighi and Klein, 2006)2, we obtained 59.5% labeled f-score on the WSJ10 setup vs. their 35.3% (Section 5). 
This is the approach in (Haghighi and Klein, 2006) for their unsupervised models6, and we use it in part of our evaluation. 
We use the prototype phrase-structure constraints provided by Haghighi and Klein (2006), and with the aid of head-finding rules, extract 14 (parent-pos,child-pos,direction) constraints.7 We then estimated target expectations for these constraints using our prior knowledge, without looking at the training data. 
5 Results We start with comparing our algorithm with (Haghighi and Klein, 2006), the only previous work that produces labeled bracketing and was tested on large manually annotated corpora.

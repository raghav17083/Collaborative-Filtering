We further show that many earlier approaches to generating complex sentences (Derr & McKeown, 1984; Davey, 1974; Kukich, 1985; Mann & Moore, 1981) have architectural limitations that would keep them from handling these types of constructions with any generality.

RELATED WORK IN GENERATION Derr & McKeown (1984) directly address the generation of complex sentences; however, they restrict the criteria for combining propositions to focus and shared arguments. 
Most state of the art text planning systems follow a common design (see for example McKeown 1985, Derr & McKeown 1984, Paris 1987, or Hovy 1988). 
We also would like to point out that our main emphasis is on the problem of 212 reversibility rather than generation, the latter involving many problems that we don't deal with here (see, e.g. Derr & McKeown, 1984; McKeown, 1985).

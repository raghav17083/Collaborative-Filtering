P09-2057:3	8:91	Because the set of target sentences T considered can be huge, previous work (Fung and Cheung, 2004; Resnik and Smith, 2003; Snover et al., 2008; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) pre-selects target sentences T at the document level . We have re-implemented a particular filtering scheme based on BM25 (Quirk et al., 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2003; Robertson et al., 1995).

P09-2057:4	71:91	This type of pre-filtering has also been used in (Quirk et al., 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2003).

It can avoid any pre-filtering at the document level (Resnik and Smith, 2003; Snover et al., 2008; Utiyama and Isahara, 2003; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Fung and Cheung, 2004).

N09-2024:12	86:93	With the help of an efficient implementation, it avoids any translation candidate selection at the document level (Resnik and Smith, 2003; Smith, 2002; Snover et al., 2008; Utiyama and Isahara, 2003; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Fung and Cheung, 2004).

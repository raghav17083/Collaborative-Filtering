Extensible Dependency Grammar (XDG) is a new grammar formalism based on Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG) (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001). 
XDG generalizes previous work on Topological Dependency Grammar (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001), which focussed on word order phenomena in German. 
XDG is a descendant of Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG) (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001), pushing the underlying methodology further by generalizing it in two aspects: number of dimensions: two in TDG (ID and LP), arbitrary many in XDG set of principles: fixed in TDG, extensible principle library in XDG The structure of this paper is as follows: In x2, we introduce XDG and the XDG solver used for parsing and generation. 
2.1 XDG intuitions Extensible Dependency Grammar (XDG) is a new grammar formalism generalizing Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG) (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001). 
The fact that we pass through a (topological) phrase structure in order to relate dependency and word order distinguishes our approach from usual dependency grammars (Mel'cuk & Pertsov, 1987; Brker, 1998; Kahane et al. , 1998; Duchier & Debusmann, 2001).

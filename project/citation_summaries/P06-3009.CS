Our parsing performance measures (SY N) thus report the PARSEVAL extension proposed in Tsarfaty (2006). 
However, Tsarfaty (2006) argues that there is a strong interaction between syntax and morphological segmentation, and that the two tasks should be modeled jointly, and not in a pipeline model. 
As pointed out by Tsarfaty (2006), joint parsing of morphology and syntax renders this indexing inappropriate, since it assumes the yields of the trees are identicalthat assumption is violated if there are any errors in the hypothesized vectorm. 
The only previous studies attempting to parse MH we know of are (Simaan et al. , 2001), applying a variation of the DOP tree-gram model to 500 sentences, and (Tsarfaty, 2006), using a treebank PCFG in an integrated system for morphological and syntactic disambiguation.9 The adaptation of state-of-the-art parsing models to MH is not immediate as the flat variable structures of phrases are hard to parse and a plentiful of morphological features that would facilitate disambiguation are not exploited by currently available parsers. 
The joint morphological and syntactic hypothesis was  rst discussed in (Tsarfaty, 2006; Tsarfaty and Simaan, 2004) and empirically explored in (Tsarfaty, 2006).

A vital component of the realizer is the hypertagger (Espinosa et al., 2008), which predicts lexical category assignments using a maxent model trained on contexts within a directed graph structure representing the logical form (LF) input; features and relations in the graph as well as parent child relationships are the main features used to train the model. 
Hypertagging (Espinosa et al., 2008) is supertagging for surface realization; it improves realizer speed and coverage with large grammars by predicting lexical category assignments with a maximum entropy model. 
2.4 Hypertagging A crucial component of the OpenCCG realizer is the hypertagger (Espinosa et al., 2008), or supertagger for surface realization, which uses a maximum entropy model to assign the most likely lexicalcategoriestothepredicatesintheinputlogical form, thereby greatly constraining the realizerssearchspace.2 Figure2showsgold-standard supertags for the lexical predicates in the graph; such category labels are predicted by the hypertagger at run-time. 
It is worth noting that improvements in our corpus-based grammar engineering process including a more precise treatment of punctuation, better named entity handling and the addition of catch-all logical form templateshave resulted in a 13.5 BLEU point improvement in our baseline realization scores on Section 00 of the CCGbank, from a score of 0.6567 in (Espinosa et al., 2008) to 0.7917 in (Rajkumar et al., 2009), contributing greatly to the state-of-the-art results reported 412 in Section 4. 
This task also enables feature extraction from LF graphs for training during supertagging for realization (Espinosa et al., 2008).

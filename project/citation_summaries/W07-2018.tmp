E09-1075:1	We will also use our measures in applications, to check their effectiveness in supporting various tasks, e.g. in mapping frames across Text and Hypothesis in RTE, in linking related frames in discourse, or in inducing frames for LU which are not in FrameNet (Baker et al., 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1008:2	The NLP community has recently devoted much attention to developing accurate and robust methods for performing role-semantic analysis automatically, and a number of multi-system evaluations have been carriedout(Litkowski, 2004; CarrerasandMrquez, 2005; Baker et al., 2007; Surdeanu et al., 2008).
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1008:3	With very few exceptions (e.g. Collobert and Weston, 2007), published SRL methods have used some sort of syntactic structure as input (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Punyakanok et al., 2008).
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1008:4	The inappropriateness of the traditional metric has led to a number of alternative metrics (Litkowski, 2004; Baker et al., 2007; Surdeanu et al., 2008).
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1008:5	Following the seminal work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), there have been many extensions in machine learning models, feature engineering (Xue and Palmer, 2004), and inference procedures (Toutanova et al., 2005; Surdeanu et al., 2007; Punyakanok et al., 2008).
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1008:6	These figures are compared to the best-performing system in the CoNLL-2005 Shared Task (Punyakanok et al., 2008), referred to as Punyakanok in the table, and the best result currently published (Surdeanu et al., 2007), referred to as Surdeanu.
---------------------------------------------------
J08-2001:7	Punyakanok, Roth, and Yih (this issue) and Surdeanu et al.(2007) have shown that, in 1 The analysis summarized here was presented in the oral session at CoNLL-2005.The slides of the session, containing the results supporting this analysis, are available in the CoNLL-2005 shared task Web site.
---------------------------------------------------
J08-2001:8	Joint scoring and combination components open the door to richer types of features, which may take into account global properties of the candidate solution plus dependencies among the different arguments.The most remarkable work in this direction is the reranking approach by Toutanova, Haghighi, and Manning in this issue.When training the ranker to select the best candidate solution they codify pattern features as strings containing the whole argument structure of the candidate.Several variations of this type of feature (with different degrees of generalization to avoid sparseness) allow them to signicantly increase the performance of the base system.Also related, Pradhan et al.(2005b) and Surdeanu et al.(2007) convert the condence scores of several base SRL systems into features for training a nal machine learningbased combination system.Surdeanu et al.(2007) develop a broad spectrum of features, with sentencebased information, describing the role played by the candidate argument in every solution proposed by the different base SRL systems.
---------------------------------------------------
J08-2001:9	With the advent of supporting resources, SRL has become a well-dened task with a substantial body of work and comparative evaluation (see, among others, Gildea and Jurafsky [2002], Surdeanu et al.[2003], Xue and Palmer [2004], Pradhan et al.[2005a], the CoNLL Shared Task in 2004 and 2005, and Senseval-3 and SemEval-2007).The identication of event frames may potentially benet many natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as information extraction (Surdeanu et al.2003), question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu 2004), summarization (Melli et al.2005), and machine translation (Boas 2002).Related work on classifying the semantic relations in noun phrases has also been encouraging for NLP tasks (Moldovan et al.2004; Rosario and Hearst 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
J08-2001:10	An important consideration within this general SRL architecture is the combination of systems and input annotations.Most SRL systems include some kind of combination to increase robustness, gain coverage, and reduce effects of parse errors.One may combine: (1) the output of several independent SRL basic systems (Surdeanu et al.2007; Pradhan et al.2005b), or (2) several outputs from the same SRL system obtained by changing input annotations or other internal parameters (Koomen et al. 2005; Toutanova, Haghighi, and Manning 2005).The combination can be as simple as selecting the best among the set of complete candidate solutions, but usually consists of combining fragments of alternative solutions to construct the nal output.Finally, the combination component may involve machine learning or not.The gain in performance from the combination step is consistently between two and three F 1 points.However, a combination approach increases system complexity and penalizes efciency.
---------------------------------------------------
J08-2001:11	5.EmpiricalEvaluationsofSRLSystems Many experimental studies have been conducted since the work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), including seven international evaluation tasks in ACL-related conferences and workshops: the SIGNLL CoNLL shared tasks in 2004 and 2005 (Carreras and M`arquez 2004, 2005), the SIGLEX Senseval-3 in 2004 (Litkowski 2004), and four tasks in the SIGLEX SemEval in 2007 (Pradhan et al.2007; M `arquez et al.2007; Baker, Ellsworth, and Erk 2007; Litkowski and Hargraves 2007).In the subsequent sections, we summarize their main features, results, and conclusions, although note that the scores are not directly comparable across different exercises, due to differences in scoring and in the experimental methodologies.
---------------------------------------------------
J08-2001:12	5.5SRLonLanguagesOtherThanEnglish SemEval-2007 featured the rst evaluation exercise of SRL systems for languages other than English, namely for Spanish and Catalan (M`arquez et al.2007).The data was part of the CESS-ECE corpus, consisting of 100K tokens for each language.The semantic role annotations are similar to PropBank, in that role labels are specic to each verb, but also include a verb-independent thematic role label similar to the scheme proposed in VerbNet.The task consisted of assigning semantic class labels to target verbs, and identifying and labeling arguments of such verbs, in both cases using gold-standard syntax.Only two teams participated, with best results at 86% for disambiguating predicates, and at 83% for labeling arguments.
---------------------------------------------------
J08-2001:13	1 SemEval-2007 included a task on semantic evaluation for English, combining word sense disambiguation and SRL based on PropBank (Pradhan et al.2007).Unlike the CoNLL tasks, this task concentrated on 50 selected verbs.Interestingly, the data was annotated using verb-independent roles using the PropBank/VerbNet mapping from Yi, Loper, and Palmer (2007).The two participating systems could predict VerbNet roles as accurately as PropBank verb-dependent roles.
---------------------------------------------------
J08-2001:14	Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) presented a compact set of features across these three types, which has served as the core of most of the subsequent SRL work: (1) the phrase type, headword, and governing category of the constituent; (2) the lemma, voice, and subcategorization pattern of the verb; and (3) the left/right position of the constituent with respect to the verb, and the category path between them.Extensions to these features have been proposed in various directions.Exploiting the ability of some machine learning algorithms to work with very large feature spaces, some authors have largely extended the representation of the constituent and its context, including among others: rst and last words (and part-of-speech) in the constituent, bag-of-words, n-grams of part of speech, and sequence of top syntactic elements in the constituent.Parent and sibling constituents in the tree may also be codied with all the previous structural and lexical features (Pradhan et al.2005a; Surdeanu et al.2007).Other authors have designed new features with specic linguistic motivations.For instance, Surdeanu et al.(2003) generalized the concept of headword with the content word feature.They also used named entity labels as features.Xue and Palmer (2004) presented the syntactic frame feature, which captures the overall sentence structure using the verb predicate and the constituent as pivots.All these features resulted in a signicant increase in performance.
---------------------------------------------------
J08-2001:15	Several exceptions to this described architecture for SRL can be found in the literature.One approach entails joint labeling of all predicates of the sentence, instead of proceeding one by one.This opens the possibility of exploiting dependencies among the different verbs in the sentence.However, the complexity may grow signicantly, and results so far are inconclusive (Carreras, M`arquez, and Chrupaa 2004; Surdeanu et al. 2007).Other promising approaches draw on dependency parsing rather than traditional phrase structure parsing (Johansson and Nugues 2007), or combine parsing and SRL into a single step of semantic parsing (Musillo and Merlo 2006).
---------------------------------------------------
E09-1026:16	These annotations are often used 1The approaches are too numerous to list; we refer the interested reader to the proceedings of the SemEval-2007 shared task (Baker et al., 2007) for an overview of the stateof-the-art.
---------------------------------------------------
E09-1026:17	This is partly due to its relevance for applications ranging from information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003; Moschittietal., 2003)toquestionanswering(Shenand Lapata, 2007), paraphrase identification (Pado and Erk, 2005), and the modeling of textual entailment relations (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005).
---------------------------------------------------
C08-1050:18	A dependency parser based on this syntax was used in the best-performing system in the SemEval-2007 task on Frame-semantic Structure Extraction (Baker et al., 2007), and the conversion method (in two different forms) was used for the English data in the CoNLL Shared Tasks of 2007 and 2008.
---------------------------------------------------
C08-1050:19	Out-of-domain Test Sets We finally conducted an evaluation of the semantic role classification accuracies on an out-ofdomain test set: the FrameNet-annotated Nuclear Threat Initiative texts from SemEval task (Baker et al., 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
C08-1050:20	The inappropriateness of the traditional metric has led to a number of alternative metrics (Litkowski, 2004; Baker et al., 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
C08-1050:21	role-semantic analysis automatically (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Litkowski, 2004; Carreras and Mrquez, 2005; Baker et al., 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
W09-2417:22	Identifying the semantic roles of the predicates in a text allows knowing who did what to whom when where how, etc. SRL has attracted much attention in recent years, as witnessed by several shared tasks in Senseval/SemEval (M`arquez et al., 2007; Litkowski, 2004; Baker et al., 2007; Diab et al., 2007), and CoNLL (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005; Surdeanu et al., 2008).
---------------------------------------------------
W09-2417:23	The state-of-the-art in semantic role labelling has now advanced so much that a number of studies have shown that automatically inferred semantic argument structures can lead to tangible performance gains in NLP applications such as information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003), question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007) or recognising textual entailment (Burchardt and Frank, 2006).
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1029:24	The algorithm proved effective at Senseval-3 (Mihalcea and Edmonds, 2004) and, nowadays, it still represents the state-of-the-art in WSD (Pradhan et al., 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1029:25	In fact, this task has raised growing interest in the NLP community, with a devoted challenge at the last SemEval campaign (Baker et al., 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
L08-1596:26	And while the MULTEXT-East tagset and corpus encoding practices have been adopted for a number of Slovene corpora, among them the reference corpora FIDA (Erjavec et al., 1998) and FidaPLUS (Arhar and Gorjanc, 2007), the 1984 corpus itself is nevertheless small (100,000 words) and contains only one translated novel, resulting in very brittle tagging models (Erjavec and S</context> <context> procedure; Section 5.
---------------------------------------------------
L08-1596:27	And while the MULTEXT-East tagset and corpus encoding practices have been adopted for a number of Slovene corpora, among them the reference corpora FIDA (Erjavec et al., 1998) and FidaPLUS (Arhar and Gorjanc, 2007), the 1984 corpus itself is nevertheless small (100,000 words) and contains only one translated novel, resulting in very brittle tagging models (Erjavec and Sarossy, 2006).
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1002:28	With regard to semantic similarity, WordNet is a prime contender and indeed has been previously used to acquire new predicates in FrameNet (Pennacchiotti et al., 2008; Burchardt et al., 2005; Johansson and Nugues, 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1002:29	Considering how the performance of supervised systems degrades on out-of-domain data (Baker et al., 2007), not to mention unseen events, semisupervised or unsupervised methods seem to offer the primary near-term hope for broad coverage semantic role labeling.
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1002:30	A variety of methods have been developed for semantic role labeling with reasonably good performance (F1 measures in the low 80s on standard test collections for English; we refer the interested reader to the proceedings of the SemEval-2007 shared task (Baker et al., 2007) for an overview of the state-of-the-art).
---------------------------------------------------
W09-1127:31	The system was integrated into the SALSA RTE system for textual entailment (Burchardt et al., 2007) to cope with sparsedata problems in the automatic assignment of frame labels.
---------------------------------------------------
W09-1127:32	In particular, resources annotated with the surface realization of semantic roles, like FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) or PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) have shown to convey an improvement in several NLP tasks, from question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007) to textual entailment (Burchardt et al., 2007) and shallow semantic parsing (Giuglea and Moschitti, 2006).
---------------------------------------------------
W09-1127:33	This is the main point of difference between our and some previous works, e.g. Johansson and Nugues (2007) and De Cao et al.
---------------------------------------------------
W09-1127:34	They used the mapping in the Semeval-2007 task on frame-semantic structure extraction (Baker et al., 2007) in order to find target words in open text and assign frames.
---------------------------------------------------
W09-1321:35	On the other hand, the extraction of linguisticallyoriented semantics from text has long been studied in computational linguistics, and has recently been formalized as Semantic Role Labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and semantic structure extraction (Baker et al., 2007)(Surdeanu et al., 2008).
---------------------------------------------------
W09-1321:36	The BioInfer (Pyysalo et al., 2007) and the GENIA event corpus (Kim et al., 2008) provide annotations of such semantic structures on collections of bio-medical articles.
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1048:37	Therefore, there is nowadays a pressing need to adopt learning approaches to extend the coverage of the FrameNet lexicon by automatically acquiring new LUs, a task we call LU induction, as recently proposed at SemEval-2007 (Baker et al., 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1048:38	(Bar-Haim et al., 2005; Garoufi, 2007)) indicate that frame semantics plays a central role in Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE).
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1048:39	LU induction has been integrated at SemEval-2007 as part of the Frame Semantic Structure Extraction shared task (Baker et al., 2007), where systems are requested to assign the correct frame to a given LU, even when the LU is not yet present in FrameNet.
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1048:40	Johansson and Nugues (2007) also experiment with a simple model based on standard WordNet similarity measures (Pedersen et al., 2004), achieving lower performance.
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1048:41	We also tested our models on a realistic gold-standard set of 24 unknown LUs extracted from the SemEval-2007 corpus (Baker et al., 2007).

There are around a dozen different implementations of the language and large DATR lexicons have been constructed for use in a variety of applications (Cahill and Evans, 1990; Andry et al. , 1992; Cahill, 1994). 
DATR has been applied to problems in inflectional and derivational morphology (Gazdar, 1992; Kilbury, 1992; Corbett and Fraser, 1993), lexical semantics (Kilgariff, 1993), morphonology (Cahill, 1993), prosody (Gibbon and Bleiching, 1991) and speech (Andry et al. , 1992). 
There are around a dozen different implementations of DATR in existence and largescale DATR lexicons have been designed for use in a number of natural language processing applications (Cahill and Evans, 1990; Andry et al. , 1992; Cahill, 1994). 
The formalism has been applied to a wide variety of problems, including inflectional and derivational morphology (Gazdar, 1992; Kilbury, 1992; Corbett and Fraser, 1993), lexical semantics (Kilgariff, 1993), morphonology (Cahill, 1993), prosody (Gibbon and Bleiching, 1991) and speech (Andry et al. , 1992). 
At the time of writing, we know of a dozen different implementations of the language, some of which have been used with large DATR lexicons in the context of big NLP systems (e.g. , Andry et al. 1992; Cahill 1993a, 1994; Cahill and Evans 1990).

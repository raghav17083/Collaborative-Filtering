3 Construction of Example Base In the construction of bilingual knowledge base (example base) in example-based machine translation system (Sato and Nagao, 1990; Watanabe et al. , 2000), translation examples are usually annotated by mean of a pair analyzed structures, where the corresponding relations between the source and target sentences are established at the structural level through the explicit links. 
To resolve this problem, example-based machine translations (Sato and Nagao, 1990; Akama and Ichikawa, 1979; Stanfill and Waltz, 1986; Sumita et al. , 1993) have recently been proposed. 
their translations) has been implemented as the knowledge (Nagao 1984; Sumita and Tsutsumi 1988; Sato and Nagao 1989; Sadler 1989a; Sumita et al. 1990a, b). 
Other technologies such as lexical-transfer MT (Nirenburg et al. , 1995; Frederking and Brown, 1996; MacDonald, 1963), and Example-Based MT (EBMT) (Brown, 1996; Na61 gao, 1984: Sato and Nagao, 1990) provide lowerquality general-purpose translations, unless they are incorporated into human-assisted MT systems (Frederking et al. , 1993; Melby, 1983), but can be used in non-domain-restricted translation applications.

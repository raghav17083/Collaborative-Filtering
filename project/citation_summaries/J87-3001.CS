This approach differs from others that have been proposed for the Thus we differ From other attempts at disambiguating definitions, (such as Alshawi 1987), which leave these "with" cases unresolved. 
After the first work on machine-readable dictiona,'ies (MRI)s) in the seventies (see Olney 1972, Sherman 1974), and with the recent development oI~the concept of'a lexical database (l.l)B) in which interaction, flexibility and multidiinensionality can be achieved, but everything must be explicitly stated in advance (see e.g. Amsler 1980, Byrd 1983, Calzolari 1982, Michiels 1980), a new possibility which is now emerging is that o1" a procedural exploitation of the lull range of semantic intbrmation implicitly contained in MRI)s (see Wilks 1987, Binot 1987, Alshawi forthcoming, Calzolari forthcoming). 
Just one example, from a number of projects currently under way in Cambridge, illustrating this point is the work of Alshawi (1987), who has analysed definition texts across an entire dictionary to produce a ~definition grammar ~ together with an associated technique for parsing the natural language descriptions of words into semantic structures. 
Much of the MRD-based research has focused on the analysis and exploitation of the sense definitions in MRDs (Amsler 1984a, 1984b, 1987; Alshawi 1987; Alshawi, Boguraev, and Carter 1989; Vossen, Meijs, and denBroeder 1989).

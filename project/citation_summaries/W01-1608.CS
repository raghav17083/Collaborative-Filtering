To deal with variations of linguistic expressions, paraphrasing has recently been studied for various applications of natural language processing, such as machine translation (Mitamura, 2001; Shimohata and Sumita, 2002), dialog systems (Ebert et al. , 2001), QA systems (Katz, 1997) and information extraction (Shinyama et al. , 2002).

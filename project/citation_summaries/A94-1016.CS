In Machine Translation (MT), there is a long tradition of combining multiple machine translations, as through a Multi-Engine MT (MEMT) architecture; the origins of this are generally credited to Frederking and Nirenburg (1994). 
Approaches to combination generally either select one of the hypotheses produced by the different systems combined (Nomoto, 2004; Paul et al. , 2005; Lee, 2005) or combine lattices/n-best lists from the different systems with different degrees of synthesis or mixing (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994; Bangalore et al. , 2001; Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Matusov et al. , 2006). 
It proves that such consensus translations are usually better than the output of individual systems (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994). 
The machine translation (MT) technology is the MultiEngine Machine Translation (MEMT) architecture (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994), described further below. 
Other approaches combine lattices or N-best lists from several different MT systems (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994).

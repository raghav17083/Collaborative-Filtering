The approach used by Powers (1997b) is only intended to identify typing errors and substitution errors (e.g. 'there' for 'their') and builds and stores a differential grammar only when the word can be disambiguated from its closed-class context, but already constraints based on the closed class words and functional affixes suffices to perform better than commercial grammar checkers. 
Note that Powers (1997a) generalizes the approach and considers a multitude of different clustering metrics and methods, introducing a pair of goodness measures which allow a more principled approach to closing and evaluating clusters (rather than closing at a specific cluster, you close when the goodness measure reaches its first local maximum). 
In addition, even the initial functional segments found may be used directly to learn or check a grammar (Entwisle and Groves, 1994; Powers, 1997b), although this already makes use of the known word segmentation and the assumption, which is for English is an excellent first approximation, that affixes are either word initial or word final, and that it is this prefixes and suffixes which determine the syntactic roles of the words. 
In Powers (1997a) both 'y' and space were identified as vowels using certain clustering techniques and methods (and the issues are discussed in that paper). 
Until now, many methods have been proposed for this problem including winnow-based algorithms (Golding and Roth, 1999), differential grammars (Powers, 1998), transformation based learning (Mangu and Brill, 1997), decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994).

Some of these are mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1989), distributed frequency (Tapanainen et al. , 1998) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) model (Baldwin et al. , 2003). 
Previous studies determine compositionality by looking at the degree of distributional similarity between an expression and its component words (e.g. , McCarthy et al. , 2003; Bannard et al. , 2003; Baldwin et al. , 2003). 
This is especially interesting since much previous research has focused solely on the non-compositionality of MWEs to identify them (McCarthy et al. , 2003; Baldwin et al. , 2003; Bannard et al. , 2003). 
2 Related Work The issue of MWE processing has attracted much attention from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community, including Smadja, 1993; Dagan and Church, 1994; Daille, 1995; 1995; McEnery et al. , 1997; Wu, 1997; Michiels and Dufour, 1998; Maynard and Ananiadou, 2000; Merkel and Andersson, 2000; Piao and McEnery, 2001; Sag et al. , 2001; Tanaka and Baldwin, 2003; Dias, 2003; Baldwin et al. , 2003; Nivre and Nilsson, 2004 Pereira et al,. 
Other approaches use Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to determine the similarity between a potential idiom and its components (Baldwin et al., 2003).

In a recent study of judgement consistency (Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2006), relevant nuggets were judged as either 'vital' or 'okay' by 10 different judges rather than the single assessor standardly used in TREC. 
3 Nugget Pyramids in TREC 2006 Lin and Demner-Fushman (2006) present experimental evidence in support of nugget pyramids by applying the proposal to results from previous TREC QA evaluations. 
In particular, we examine the recent so-called pyramid extension that incorporates relevance judgments from multiple assessors to improve evaluation stability (Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2006). 
3.2 Results After the human annotation process, nugget pyramids were built in the manner described by Lin and Demner-Fushman (2006).

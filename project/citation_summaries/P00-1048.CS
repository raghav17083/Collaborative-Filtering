The morpheme-unit POS tagging model is to find the most likely sequence of morphemes C5 and corresponding POS tags CC for a given sentence CF, as follows (Kim et al. , 1998; Lee et al. , 2000): A0B4CFB5 CSCTCU BP CPD6CVD1CPDC C5BNCC C8B4C5BNCCCYCFB5 BP CPD6CVD1CPDC D1 BDBND9 BND8 BDBND9 C8B4D1 BDBND9 BND8 BDBND9 CYDB BDBND2 B5 (1) AP CPD6CVD1CPDC D1 BDBND9 BND8 BDBND9 C8B4D1 BDBND9 BND8 BDBND9 B5 (2) In the equation, D9B4BQBP D2B5 denotes the number of morphemes in the sentence.

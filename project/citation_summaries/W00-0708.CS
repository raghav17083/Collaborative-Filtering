4 Conclusions and Future Work With the Charniak (Charniak, 2001) language model, our results exceed those of the previous best (Minnen et al. , 2000) on the determiner selection task.

More recently, data-driven approaches have gained popularity and been applied to article prediction in English (Knight and Chander 1994; Minnen et al, 2000; Turner and Charniak 2007), to an array of Japanese learners errors in English (Izumi et al, 2003), to verb errors (Lee and Seneff, 2008), and to article and preposition correction in texts written by non-native ELLs (Han et al, 2004, 2006; Nagata et al, 2005; Nagata et al, 2006; De Felice and Pulman, 2007; Chodorow et al, 2007; Gamon et al, 2008, 2009; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008a). 
In fact, these features dominated the 10 heaviest weights in our training; they were not used in (Minnen et al. , 2000). 
Our best result, 87.7%, is an improvement over both (Minnen et al. , 2000) and (Knight and Chander, 1994).

While we agree with (Traum and Allen, 1994) that cooperation between agents who are not part of a group has to be explained by some mechanism which obliges an agent to answer at least for refusing explicitly we want to go deeper inside the notion of obligation and try to show that it is strictly related to that of intention. 
While in (Traum and Allen, 1994) discourse obligations are social norms that speakers have to learn, in our model, the speakers have to learn in what conditions humans happen to be offended; this same knowledge explains the use of indirect speech acts (as in (Ardissono et al. , 1999)). 
Traum and Allen (1994) show how discourse obligations can be used to account in a natural manner for the connection between a question and its answer in dialogue and how obligations can be used along with other parts of the discourse context to extend the coverage of a dialogue system. 
CommandTalk (Moore et al. , 1997), Circuit Fix-It Shop (Smith, 1997) and TRAINS-96 (Traum and Allen, 1994; Tranm and Andersen, 1999) are spoken language systems but they interface to simulation or help facilities rather than semi-autonomous agents. 
4 Related Work (Traum and Allen, 1994) defined a model of linguistic interaction based on the notion of obligation.

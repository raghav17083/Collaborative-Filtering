The segmental structure of discourse has been claimed to constrain and be constrained by disparate phenomena: cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Gross and Sidner, 1986; Reichman, 1985; Cohen, 1984); lexical cohesion (Morris and Hirst, 1991); plans and intentions (Carberry, 1990; Litman and Allen, 1990; Gross and Sidner, 1986); prosody (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Gross, 1992; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert, 1986); reference (Webber, 1991; Gross and Sidner, 1986; Linde, 1979); and tense (Webber, 1988; Hwang and Schubert, 1992; Song and Cohen, 1991).

2.2 Correlation of Segmentation with Utterance Features The segmental structure of discourse has been claimed to constrain and be constrained by disparate phenomena, e.g., cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman 1993; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Reichman 1985; Cohen 1984), plans and intentions (Carberry 1990; Litman and Allen 1990; Grosz and Sidner 1986), prosody (Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986; Butterworth 1980), nominal reference (Webber 1991; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Linde 1979), and tense (Webber 1988; Hwang and Schubert 1992; Song and Cohen 1991).

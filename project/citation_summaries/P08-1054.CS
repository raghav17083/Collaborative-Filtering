This obviously does not preclude using the audio-based system together with other features such as utterance position, length, speakers roles, and most others used in the literature (Penn and Zhu, 2008). 
Audio data amenable to summarization include meeting recordings (Murray et al., 2005), telephone conversations (Zhu and Penn, 2006; Zechner, 2001), news broadcasts (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2005; Christensen et al., 2004), presentations (He et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2007; Penn and Zhu, 2008), etc. Although extractive summarization is not as ideal as abstractive summarization, it outperforms several comparable alternatives. 
3The usefulness of position varies significantly in different genres (Penn and Zhu, 2008). 
1 Introduction Summarizing spoken documents has been extensively studied over the past several years (Penn and Zhu, 2008; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2005; Murray et al., 2005; Christensen et al., 2004; Zechner, 2001). 
In practice, we used MMR in our experiments, since the original MEAD considers also sentence positions 3 , which can always been added later as in (Penn and Zhu, 2008).

To compensate for this, Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou (1999) propose to compute the transitive closure of the ordering relation: if a c and c b, then a b. Malouf (2000) further proposes a back-off bigram model of adjective pairs for choosing among alternative orders (P(ha;bijfa;bg) vs. P(hb;aijfa;bg)). 
A simplex NP is defined as a maximal noun phrase that includes premodifiers such as determiners and possessives but no post-nominal constituents such as prepositional phrases or relative clauses (Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou, 1999: 137). 
3.2 Direct evidence The simplest strategy for ordering adjectives is what Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou (1999) call the direct evidence method. 
Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou, 1999; Malouf, 2000). 
As frequently noted in the literature (e.g. , Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou, 1999), the linear order of modifiers can signify their logical scope (though other factors are involved, too), as in the English examples (1) and (2) (bracketing indicates logical scope): (1) my [favorite [new movie]] (2) my [new [favorite movie]] In (1) favorite modifies the phrase new movie; hence the NP refers to my favorite among the new movies (there may be an old movie I like better); in (2) new modifies favorite movie; hence the NP refers to my favorite movie, which has just become my favorite.

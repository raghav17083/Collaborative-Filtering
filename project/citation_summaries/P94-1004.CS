3.2 Statistical Learning Model 3.2.1 Nave Bayes Learning Nave Bayes learning has been widely used in natural language processing with good results such as statistical syntactic parsing (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997), hidden language understanding (Miller et al. , 1994). 
Many understanding engines have been successfully implemented based on this paradigm (Seneff, 1992; Potamianos et al. , 2000; Miller et al. , 1994). 
4,2 The Noisy Channel Model The "noisy-channel" model from information theory has proven highly effective in speech recognition and, more recently, in language understanding (Epstein et al. , 1996; Miller et al. , 1994). 
Traditionally, there are mainly two mainstreams in the SLU researches: knowledge-based approaches, which are based on robust parsing or template matching techniques (Sneff, 1992; Dowding et al. , 1993; Ward and Issar, 1994); and data-driven approaches, which are generally based on stochastic models (Pieraccini and Levin, 1993; Miller et al. , 1995). 
To address these issues, it has been proposed (Miller et al. , 1994; Wang, 2000; Esteve et al. , 2003) that one can extend the statistical pattern recognition framework commonly used for automatic speech recognition (ASR) to the spoken language understanding (SLU) problem.

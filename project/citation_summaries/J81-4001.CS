Focusing techniques (Grosz 1977; Sidner 1981; Robinson 1981; McKeown 1985; Carberry 1988) are necessary in order to identify that portion of the underlying plan to which a fragmentary utterance refers. 
Such constructs can include tense 96 and aspect (Moens and Steedman, 1988; Webber, 1988; Lascarides and Asher, 1993), certain patterns of pronominalization and anaphoric usages (Sidner, 1981; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Sumita et al. , 1992; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1995),/t-clefts (Delin and Oberlander, 1992), and discourse markers or cue phrases (Ballard, Conrad, and Longacre, 1971; Halliday and Hasan, 1976; Van Dijk, 1979; Longacre, 1983; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Schiffrin, 1987; Cohen, 1987; Redeker, 1990; Sanders, Spooren, and Noordman, 1992; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Knott, 1995; Fraser, 1996; Moser and Moore, 1997). 
The fact that current anaphora resolution systems rely exclusively on the linear nature of texts in Order to determine the LPA of an anaphor seems odd, given that several studies have claimed that there is a strong relation between discourse structure and reference (Sidner, 1981; Gmsz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et aL, 1995; Fox, 1987; Vonk et al. , 1992; Azzam et al. , 1998; Hitzeman and P.oesio, 1998). 
Sidner (1981) employs a similar strategy in her work on anaphora resolution. 
McKeown (1985) expanded on focus rules proposed by Sidner (1981) to explain how speakers should organize their utterances when faced with a choice of topic.

If keywords to be confirmed are defined, the system can confirm them using confidence measures (Komatani and Kawahara, 2000; Hazen et al. , 2000) to manage the errors. 
Furthermore, condence scores, which enable an efcient dialogue management (Komatani and Kawahara, 2000), can be calculated by ranking these results or by voting on them, by using multiplespeechunderstandingresults. 
Acondence measure CM i is assigned to each keyword i basedontheN-bestrecognition result(KomataniandKawahara,2000). 
To cope with speech recognition errors, several confirmation strategies have been proposed: confirmation management methods based on confidence measures of speech recognition results (Komatani and Kawahara, 2000; Hazen et al. , 2000) and implicit confirmation that includes previous recognition results into systems prompts (Sturm et al. , 1999). 
The decision to engage these strategies is typically based on comparing the confidence score against manually preset thresholds (e.g. Kawahara and Komatani, 2000).

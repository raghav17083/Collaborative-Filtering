In this paper, I will review and assess the recent centering approach to the interpretation of Japanese zero pronouns (Walker et al. 1994) as a case study, and suggest that relevance theory can provide one way of complementing it. 
Hence, the most important single construct of the centering model is the ordering of the list of forward-looking centers (Walker et al. , 1994).

One method is to integrate different knowledge sources or factors (e.g. gender and number agreement, c-command constraints, semantic information) that discount unlikely candidates until a minimal set of plausible candidates is obtained (Grosz et al. , 1995; Lappin and Leass, 1994; Okumura and Tamura, 1996; Walker et al. , 1998; Yeh and Chen, 2001). 
In our system, the graphical displays are designed by an automatic presentation component, SAGE (Roth et al. 1994), and are often complex for several reasons.

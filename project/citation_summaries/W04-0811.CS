In two experiments we evaluate the accuracy of the tagger on the Semcor corpus itself, and on the English all words Senseval 3 shared task data (Snyder and Palmer, 2004). 
This nding is in line with previous results (Snyder and Palmer, 2004). 
2.4 Inter-Annotator Agreement Recent estimations of the inter-annotator agreement when using the WordNet inventory report figures of 72.5% agreement in the preparation of the English all-words test set at Senseval-3 (Snyder and Palmer, 2004) and 67.3% on the Open Mind Word Expert annotation exercise (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002). 
Existing hand-annotated corpora like SemCor (Miller et al. , 1993), which is annotated with WordNet senses (Fellbaum, 1998) allow for a small improvement over the simple most frequent sense heuristic, as attested in the all-words track of the last Senseval competition (Snyder and Palmer, 2004). 
(2004) reported results for English using their automatically acquired rst sense heuristic on SemCor (Miller et al., 1993) and the SENSEVAL-2 English all words dataset (Snyder and Palmer, 2004).

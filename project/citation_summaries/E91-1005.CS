Examples are tree-local and set-local multicomponent TAG (Joshi, 1985; Weir, 1988), MCTAG for short, non-local MCTAG with dominance links (Becker et al., 1991), Vector-TAG with dominance links (Rambow, 1994) and, more recently, Tree-Tuple MCTAG with Shared Nodes (Lichte, 2007)), or TT-MCTAG for short. 
The move to MCSG is motivated by our desire to more perspicuously account for certain syntactic phenomena that cannot be easily captured by context-free grammars, such as clitic climbing, extraposition, and other types of longdistance movement (Becker et al. , 1991). 
MCTAG with Domination Links (MCTAG-DL) (Becker et al. , 1991) are multicomponent systems that allow for the expression of dominance constraints. 
A pomset mcfg G is a 7-tuple (,N,O,P,F,R,S) such that  is a finite non-empty set of atoms, i.e. terminal symbols, N is a finite non-empty set of nonterminal symbols, where N=, O is a set of valid pomset operators, P is a set of i-tuples of pomsets labelled by N, F is a finite set of pomset rewriting functions from tuples of elements of P into elements in P, F{ g:Pn P | n>0 }, R is a finite set 2Pomset isolation is similar to proposals in for string isolation in linear specification language (Goetz and Penn, 2000), locking in idl-expressions (Nederhof and Satta, 2004), and integrity constraints in fo-tag (Becker et al. , 1991). 
(Becker et al. , 1991), with research dedicated to this topic virtually nonexistent.

The new category-learning algorithm is compared to two other algorithms, namely the baseline segmentation algorithm presented in (Creutz, 2003), which was also utilized for initializing the segmentation in the category-learning algorithm, and the Linguistica algorithm (Goldsmith, 2001).3 4.1 Data sets The Finnish corpus consists of mainly news texts from the CSC (The Finnish IT Center for Science)4 and the Finnish News Agency. 
Creutz (2003) proposes a probabilistic maximum a posteriori formulation that uses prior distributions of morpheme length and frequency to measure the goodness of an induced morpheme, achieving better results for Finnish but worse results for English in comparison to Goldsmith s Linguistica. 
Experiments show that the new algorithm is able to obtain considerable improvements over the segmentation produced by the algorithm described in (Creutz, 2003). 
Typically, generative models are used, either formulated in a Bayesian framework, e.g., (Brent, 1999; Creutz, 2003); or applying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, e.g., (de Marcken, 1996; Goldsmith, 2001; Creutz and Lagus, 2002). 
Creutz (2003) presents an algorithm for unsupervised segmentation under these assumptions.

Motivated by Kay's work, (Kiraz, 1994) proposed a multi-tape two-level model. 
Although particularly suited to concatenative morphology, this approach has been extended to other types of morphologies, and more precisely to templatic morphology first by Kay (1987), then by Beesley (1991,1996) and Kiraz (1994, 1996) among others. 
The kinds of non-linear effects common in Semitic languages, where vowel and consonant patterns are interpolated in words (Kay, 1987; Kiraz, 1994) could be treated efficiently by the mechanisms described here if it proved possible to define a representation that allowed the parts of an inflected word corresponding to the root to be separated fairly cleanly from the parts expressing the inflection. 
The attempts to model Arabic morphology in a two-level system (Kays (1987) Finite State Model, Beesleys (1990; 1998) Two-Level Model and Kirazs (1994) Multi-tape Two-Level Model) reflect McCarthys separation of levels. 
This work departs from two-level morphology, which has been at the center of computational morphology since the implementation of URKIMMO (Koskenniemi 1983) and was applied to Arabic morphology first by Kay (1987), then by Beesley (1989, 1996), Kiraz (1994, 1996a) and to Syriac morphology by Kiraz (1996b).

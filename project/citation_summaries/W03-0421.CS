In the classi erbased approach, we used simple features such as the current word and surrounding 4 words, binary tags indicating if the word considered contains any digits or is formed from digits, and features checking capitalization (Carreras et al. , 2003). 
Carreras et al. presented results of a NER system for Catalan using Spanish resources (Carreras et al. , 2003a). 
The relevant algorithms include Maximum Entropy (Borthwick, 1999; Klein et al. , 2003), Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Bikel et al. , 1999; Klein et al. , 2003), AdaBoost (Carreras et al. , 2003), Memorybased learning (Meulder and Daelemans, 2003), Support Vector Machine (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002), Robust Risk Minimization (RRM) Classification method (Florian et al. , 2003), etc. For Chinese NER, most of the existing approaches use hand-crafted rules with word (or character) frequency statistics. 
Two teams used AdaBoost.MH (Carreras et al. , 2003b; Wu et al. , 2003) and two other groups employed memory-based learning (De Meulder and Daelemans, 2003; Hendrickx and Van den Bosch, 2003). 
In contrast to other methods we do not perform binary classifications, as (Carreras et al. , 2003b), thus we do not build specialized classifiers for each of the tags.

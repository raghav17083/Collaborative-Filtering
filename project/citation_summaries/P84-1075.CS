Such elements, called feature structures, have been used in linguistic theories, such as Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG; Gadzar et al. 1985) and Lexical Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan 1983), and in computational formalisms, such as Functional Unification Grammar (Kay 1979) and PATR-II (Shieber 1984). 
In FUG Kay (1979, 1985), LFG Kaplan and Bresnan (1982), and work by Shieber and others on PATR II Shieber (1984), this traditional distinction disappears almost entirely. 
Recent developments in linguistics, and especially on grammatical theory -for example, Generalised Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar et al. , 1985), Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) -and on natural language parsing frameworks for example, Functional Unification Grammar (FUG) (Kay, 1984a), PATR-II (Shieber, 1984) -make it feasible to consider the implementation of efficient systems for the syntactic analysis of substantial fragments of natural language. 
This is in fact proposed in the literature by Shieber (1984) and Pollard (1985).

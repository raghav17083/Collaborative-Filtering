We start from a technique introduced recently by Van den Bosch and Daelemans (2005), and reinterpret it as an instance of the classification and inference approach. 
Van den Bosch and Daelemans (2005) propose to resolve parts of this issue by predicting trigrams of labels as a single atomic class label, thereby labelling three tokens at once, rather than classifying each token separately. 
While the original voting-based inference procedure proposed by Van den Bosch and Daelemans (2005) manages to exploit the sequential information stored in the predicted trigrams to improve upon the performance of approaches that do not consider the sequential structure of their output at all, it does so only partly. 
Applying this general idea, Van den Bosch and Daelemans (2005) label each token with a complex class label composed of the labels for the preceding token, the token itself, and the one following it in the sequence. 
However, it should be emphasised that, while both methods trace back their origins to the work of Van den Bosch and Daelemans (2005), constraint satisfaction inference is not applied after, but instead of majority voting.

A number of different supervised machine learning techniques have been applied to the task of automatic syllable boundary detection, including decision-tree classifiers (van den Bosch et al. , 1998), weighted finite state transducers (Kiraz and Mobius, 1998), and PCFGs (Muller, 2001; Muller, 2002).

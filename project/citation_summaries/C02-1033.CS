The major distinction between these methods is in the contrast between the approaches based exclusively on the information contained in the text to be segmented, such as lexical repetition (e.g., Choi 2000; Hearst 1997; Heinonen 1998; Kehagias, Pavlina, and Petridis 2003; Utiyama and Isahara 2001), and those approaches that rest on complementary semantic knowledge extracted from dictionaries and thesauruses (e.g., Kozima 1993; Lin et al. 2004; Morris and Hirst 1991), or from collocations collected in large corpora (Bolshakov and Gelbukh 2001; Brants, Chen, and Tsochantaridis 2002; Choi et al. 2001; Ferret 2002; Kaufmann 1999; Ponte and Croft 1997). 
This network is used by TOPICOLL (Ferret, 2002), a topic analyzer, which performs simultaneously three tasks, relevant for this goal: it segments texts into topically homogeneous segments; it selects in each segment the most representative words of its topic; 7 Such a network is only another view of a set of cooccurrences: its nodes are the co-occurrent words and its edges are the co-occurrence relations. 
Collocation extraction methods have been used not only for English, but for many other languages: French (Ferret, 2002), German (Evert and Krenn, 2001) and Japanese (Nagao and Mori, 1994), to cite but those. 
These latter, called TIORA (Zock and Bilac, 2004) or topical relations (Ferret, 2002) account for the fact that two words refer to the same topic, or take part in the same situation or scenario. 
3.1 Method This experiment was based on the procedure and test materials designed by Choi (2000), which was also used by several authors as a benchmark for comparing segmentation systems (Brants et al. 2002; Ferret 2002; Kehagias et al. 2003; Utiyama and Isahara 2001).

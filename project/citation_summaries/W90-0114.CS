While we do not yet have an understanding of what this benefit might be, we can at this point narrow its character by identifying it with another set of phenomena, which, while also having no real explanation as yet in terms of their utility (but see Granville 1990 or Valduvf 1992), seem to us to be phenomena of the same kind.

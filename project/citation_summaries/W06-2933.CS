1 Introduction Several efficient, accurate and robust approaches to data-driven dependency parsing have been proposed recently (Nivre and Scholz, 2004; McDonald et al. , 2005; Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) for syntactic analysis of natural language using bilexical dependency relations (Eisner, 1996). 
The fact that our model defines a probability model over parse trees, unlike the previous stateof-the-art methods (Nivre et al. , 2006; McDonald et al. , 2006), makes it easier to use this model in applications which require probability estimates, such as in language processing pipelines or for language modeling. 
5.Classier-BasedDependencyParser Our second data-driven parser is based on a parsing strategy that has achieved a high parsing accuracy across a variety of different languages (Nivre et al. 2006,2007). 
This projectivisation method is similar to the HEAD method of (Nivre et al., 2006), but has two interesting new characteristics.

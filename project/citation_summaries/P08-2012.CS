E09-1051:1	248:274	The model from (Finkel and Manning, 2008) utilizes transitivity, but not exclusivity.
---------------------------------------------------
E09-1051:2	80:274	Transitivity is captured by (see (Finkel and Manning, 2008) for an alternative but equivalent formalization): ci j +c jkcik +1, i, j,k (i < j < k) cik +c jkci j +1, i, j,k (i < j < k) ci j +cikc jk +1, i, j,k (i < j < k) (3) In order to take full advantage of ILPs reasoning capacities, three equations are needed given three markables.
---------------------------------------------------
W09-1803:3	52:211	Mathematically, this objective can be written (Ailon et al., 2008; Finkel and Manning, 2008) as: min summationdisplay ij:i<j xijwij + (1xij)w+ij.
---------------------------------------------------
W09-1803:4	54:211	We can take w+ij = pij and wij = 1pij (additive weights) as in (Ailon et al., 2008) and others, or w+ij = log(pij),wij = log(1pij) (logarithmic weights) as in (Finkel and Manning, 2008).
---------------------------------------------------
W09-1803:5	32:211	Recently Finkel and Manning (2008) show that the optimal ILP solution outperforms the first and best-link methods.
---------------------------------------------------
W09-1121:6	60:267	Examples include (Finkel and Manning, 2008), using VI, Rand index and clustering F-score for evaluating coreference resolution; (Headden et al., 2008), using VI, V, greedy 1-to-1 and many-to-1 mapping for evaluating unsupervised POS induction; (Walker and Ringger, 2008), using clustering F-score, the adjusted Rand index, V, VI and Q2 for document clustering; and (Reichart and Rappoport, 2008), using greedy 1-to1 and many-to-1 mappings for evaluating labeled parse tree induction.
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1120:7	54:207	4The MUC measure is problematic when the system predicts many more clusters than actually exist (Luo, 2005; Finkel and Manning, 2008); also, singleton clusters do not contribute to evaluation.

D09-1120:9	55:207	1153 While much research (Ng and Cardie, 2002; Culotta et al., 2007; Haghighi and Klein, 2007; Poon and Domingos, 2008; Finkel and Manning, 2008) has explored how to reconcile pairwise decisions to form coherent clusters, we simply take the transitive closure of our pairwise decision (as in Ng and Cardie (2002) and Bengston and Roth (2008)) which can and does cause system errors.

N09-1065:15	27:212	It is worth noting, in particular, that Luo (2007), Denis and Baldridge (2007), and Finkel and Manning (2008) evaluate their approaches on true mentions extracted from the answer keys.
---------------------------------------------------
N09-1065:16	19:212	As another example, Denis and Baldridge (2007) and Finkel and Manning (2008) perform joint inference for anaphoricity determination and coreference resolution, by using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to enforce the consistency between the output of the anaphoricity classifier and that of the coreference classifier.
---------------------------------------------------
N09-1065:17	25:212	Second, we compare our cut-based approach with the five aforementioned approaches to anaphoricity determination (namely, Ng and Cardie (2002a), Ng (2004), Luo (2007), Denis and Baldridge (2007), and Finkel and Manning (2008)) in terms of their effectiveness in improving a learning-based coreference system.

Concepts do not have to be directly observable as text snippetsthey can represent abstract properties that particular text units may or may not satisfy, for example, status as a first sentence in a paragraph or generally position in the source text (Baxendale, 1958; Lin and Hovy, 1997). 
Machine learning has also been applied to learning individual features; for example, Lin and Hovy (1997) applied machine learning to the problem of determining how sentence position affects the selection of sentences, and Witbrock and Mittal (1999) used statistical approaches to choose important words and phrases and their syntactic context. 
Most research on single document summarization, particularly for domain independent tasks, uses sentence extraction to produce a summary (Lin and Hovy, 1997; Marcu, 1997; Salton et al. , 1991). 
Conceptual units do not have to be directly observable as text snippets; they can represent abstract properties that particular text units may or may not satisfy, for example, status as a first sentence in a paragraph or generally position in the source text (Lin and Hovy, 1997). 
For example, in summarization, Barzilay and Elhadad (1997) and Lin and Hovy (1997) focus oll multiword noun phrases.

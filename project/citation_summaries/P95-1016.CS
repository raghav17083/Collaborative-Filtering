9 Reithinger and Maier (1995) have used n-gram dialogue act probabilities to induce the adjacency pairs from a corpus of dialogues for appointment scheduling. 
Another promising area is speech act (dialogue move) tagging, where, for example, researchers have tested whether an automatic tagger trained on the tagged corpus can improve the performance of a speech recognizer with tag-specific language models (Taylor et al. 1996), and whether an induced discourse model based on the tagging can predict the next dialogue act in the dialogue, and thus affect how the system translates the next utterance (Reithinger and Maier 1995; Nagata 1992). 
5.1 Statistical Information Probability of a dialogue act type sequence Based on the same idea as Nagata and Morimoto (1994) and Reithinger and Maier (1995), we use the probability of a dialogue act type sequence, namely, the N-gram probability of dialogue act types. 
Several research efforts have explored the use of dialogue act tagging schemes for tasks such as improving recognition performance (Reithinger and Maier, 1995; Shriberg et al. , 2000), identifying important parts of a dialogue (Finke et al. , 1998), and as a constraint on nominal expression generation (Jordan, 2000). 
In the context of the dialogue component of the speech-to-speech translation system VERBMOBIL, Reithinger and Maier (1995) use n-gram dialogue act probabilities to suggest the most likely dialogue act.

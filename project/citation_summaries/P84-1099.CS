(An attempt to formalize this can be found in Krauwer and des Tombe 1984 or in section 4 of Johnson et al 1985).


It is usually assumed that there is a direct relationship between the complexity of the transfer operations and the level of abstraction of the representations; some of the issues involved in this trade-off are discussed in Krauwer & des Tombe (1984).

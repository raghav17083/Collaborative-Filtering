This probabilistic approach to lexical rules integrates neatly with extant proposals to control application of lexical rules efficiently within a constraint-based framework, such as those of Meurers and Minnen (1997). 
3 (Meurers and Minnen, 1997) propose a compilation of lexical rules into T~r/: definite clauses 2This view of typed feature structures differs from the perspective on typed feature structures as modehng partial information as in (Carpenter, 1992). 
Meurers and Minnen (1997) present a computational framework for efficient application of Meurers' (1995) formalization of lexical rules. 
Typed feature grammars can be used as the basis for implementations of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG; Pollard and Sag, 1994) as discussed in (GStz and Meurers, 1997a) and (Meurers and Minnen, 1997). 
One way of formalizing and implementing this approach is to adopt the covariation technique of Meurers and Minnen (1997) discussed in Section 2, in which finite-state machines (FSMs) representing the possible lexical rules that can apply to each basic lexical entry are associated with equivalence classes of such entries and the entry is simplified to information common between the variants.

This is the model for several existing tools, including the VisDic viewer for WordNet (Hork and Smr, 2004), the INOH ontology viewer (INOH, 2004), and the Gene Ontology viewer presented by Koike and Takagi (2004), among others.


The entire dictionary was generated by applying the automatic generation method of name variations (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2004) to the GENA dictionary for the gene names (Koike and Takagi, 2004) and the UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) meta-thesaurus for the disease names (Lindberg et al. , 1993).


For example, GENA (Koike and Takagi, 2004) is a database of genes and gene products that is semi-automatically collected from well-known databases, including HUGO, OMIM, Genatlas, Locuslink, GDB, MGI, FlyBase, WormBase, Figure 1: An output of HPSG parsing Figure 2: A predicate argument structure CYGD, and SGD.


Their system employed UMLS (Humphreys and Lindberg, 1993), GO (Ashburner et al. , 2000), and GENA (Koike and Takagi, 2004) to further improve extraction.

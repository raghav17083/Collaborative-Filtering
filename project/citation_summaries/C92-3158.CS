This is the approach used in the systems TEXT (McKeown 1985), GENARO-MUMBLE (Conklin 1983; Meteer et al. 1987), PENMAN (The Penman NLG 1989), SPOKESMAN (Meteer 1990), EPICURE (Dale 1992), KALIPSOS (Nogier 1990) and in the generators based on the Meaning-Text Theory (MTT) (Mel'Suk and Pertsov 1987) such as: FOC (Bourbeau et al. 1990), GossIP (Carcagno and Iordanskaja 1993) and LFS (Iordanskaja et al. 1994). 
Our work extends directions taken in systems such as Ariane (Vauquois and Boitet, 1985), FoG (Kittredge and Polgu6re, 1991), JOYCE (Rainbow and Korelsky, 1992), and LFS (Iordanskaja et al. , 1992). 
Versions of this generator, based on Meaning-Text Theory (Mel'~alk & Pertsov, 1987), have been used in other applications, including the generation of bilingual weather forecasts (Goldberg et al. , to appear) and statistical reports (Iordanskaja et al. , 1992). 
Other NLG systems that extract and summarise information have been developed in other research, particularly by CoGenTex; their systems include, for example, FOG (Bourbeau et al. , 1990), which produced weather reports; LFS (Iordanskaja et al. , 1992), which summarised employment statistics; and Joyce (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992), which summarised software designs from a security perspective. 
Owing to this cost, M-NLG has been applied mainly in contexts where the knowledge base is already available, having been created for another purpose (Iordanskaja et al., 1992; Goldberg et al., 1994); for discussion see Reiter and Mellish (1993).

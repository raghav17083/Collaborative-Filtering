So most of the currently developed generators and uniform algorithms assume more or less explictly an all-paraphrases strategy (e.g. , (Shieber, 1988), (Calder et al. , 1989), (Shieber et al. , 1989), (Dymetman et al. , 1990), (Emele and Zajac, 1990)). 
If the above sketched approach to semantic interpretation is followed systematically, it is possible to show that such a semantic-head-driven generation algorithm terminates (Dymetman et al. , 1990). 
245 Currently developed approaches that consider parsing as well as generation (e.g. , Shieber 1988; Shieber et al. 1990; Dymetman et al. 1990; van Noord 1990; Zajac and Emele 1990) assume:  that both tasks take place independently from each other, i.e. an utterance is either generated or parsed and  that grammatical processing can be performed without considerations of discourse. 
As an example, consider the following clauses: u A similar concept of guide-structure is introduced in (Dymetman et al. , 1990), however the ordered series is less restrictive and covers a larger class of recursive programs. 
Recently, there are first approaches to uniform architectures for grammaticallprocessing (e.g. , Shieber 1988; Dymetman and Isabelle 1988; Dymetman et al. 1990).

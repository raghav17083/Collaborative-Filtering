Amsler, 1981; Walker & Amsler, 1983), or on developing dictionary servers for office automation systems (Kay, 1984b). 
Recent developments in linguistics, and especially on grammatical theory -for example, Generalised Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar et al. , 1985), Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) -and on natural language parsing frameworks for example, Functional Unification Grammar (FUG) (Kay, 1984a), PATR-II (Shieber, 1984) -make it feasible to consider the implementation of efficient systems for the syntactic analysis of substantial fragments of natural language.

INTRODUCTION Recent developments in linguistics, and especially on grammatical theory for example, Generalised Phrase Structure Grammar' (GPSG) (Gazdar et al. , In Press), Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplan & Bresnan, 1982) and on natural language parsing frameworks for example, Functional Unification Grammar (FUG) (Kay, 1984a), PATR-II (Shieber, 1984) make it feasible to consider the implementation of efficient systems for the syntactic analysis of substantial fragments of natural language. 
More recently, a dictionary server, of the kind described by Kay (1984b), was implemented and installed as a background process on a Xerox workstation networked together with the rest of the equipment dedicated to natural language processing applications (Boguraev et al. , 1987).

There are more sophisticated surface generation packages, such as FUF/SURGE (Elhadad and Robin, 1996), KPML (Bateman, 1996), MUMBLE (Meteer et al. , 1987), and RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997), which produce natural language text from an abstract semantic representation. 
1 Introduction It has long been believed that being able to detect the correct sense of a word in a given context  performing word sense disambiguation (WSD)  will lead to improved performance of systems tackling high end applications such as machine translation (Chan et al., 2007) and summarization(Elhadad et al., 1997). 
Efficiency issues in generation were also addressed in \[McDonald et al. , 1987, Elhadad et al. , 1997\]. 
NLG2 and NLG3 solve the lexical choice problem by learning the words (via features in the maximum entropy probability model) that correlate with a given attribute and local context, whereas (Elhadad et al. , 1997) uses a rule-based approach to decide the word choice. 
Indeed, many recent text generation systems, including MOOSE (Stede 1999), ADVISOR II (Elhadad, McKeown, and Robin 1997), and Hunter-Gatherer (Beale et al. 1998), among others (see Reiter and Dales [1997] survey), adopt this view, yet their lexical-choice components do not account for near-synonymy.

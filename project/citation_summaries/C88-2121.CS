At the same time, there is growing interest in parsing with more sophisticated lexicalized grammar formalisms, such as Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Bresnan, 1982), Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) (Schabes et al. , 1988), Headdriven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag, 1994) and Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000), which represent deep syntactic structures that cannot be expressed in a shallower formalism designed to represent only aspects of surface syntax, such as the dependency formalism used in current mainstream dependency parsing. 
Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars (Schabes et al. , 1988) are a refinement of TAGs such that each elementary tree is associated with a lexieal item, called the anchor of the tree. 
XTAG provides all the utilities required for designing a lexicalized TAG structured as in Schabes et al. \[1988\]. 
1 Introduction Various parsing techniques have been developed for lexicalized grammars such as Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) (Schabes et al. , 1988), and Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag, 1994). 
Derivation trees, the structural description in LTAG (Schabes et al. , 1988), represent the association of lexical items i.e., elementary trees.

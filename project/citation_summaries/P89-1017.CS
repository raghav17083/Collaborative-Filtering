3 Theoretical considerations (Leermakers, 1989; Schabes, 1991; Nederhof, 1994b) have suggested that for natural language parsing, LR-based techniques may not necessarily be superior to other parsing techniques, although convincing empirical data to this effect has never been shown. 
Another example, on which our presentation is based, was first suggested by Leermakers (1989): a grammar is first transformed and then a standard tabular algorithm along with some filtering condition is applied using the transformed grammar. 
Following the general approach presented by Leermakers (1989), we simulate computations of 2For the earliest mention of this transformation, we have encountered pointers to Schauerte (1973). 
This uniform method of specifying grammar transformations is similar to, but clearer than, similar techniques used with covering grammars (Nijholt 1980; Leermakers 1989). 
This observation gives rise to an extension with probabilities of the work on covers by (Nijholt, 1980; Leermakers, 1989).

Linguistic Realization Some recent GRE algorithms have done away with the separation between content determination and linguistic realization, interleaving the two processes instead (Stone and Webber 1998; Krahmer and Theune 2002). 
Introduction The generation of referring expressions is one of the most common tasks in natural language generation and has been addressed by many researchers in the past two decades, including Appelt (1985), Reiter (1990), Dale and Haddock (1991), Dale (1992), Dale and Reiter (1995), Horacek (1997), Stone and Webber (1998), Krahmer and Theune (1998, 2002), Bateman (1999), and van Deemter (2000, 2002). 
In this case, we will only be able to generate a formula that denotes exactly A =fag (i.e., a RE that uniquely refers to a) if there is no 43 f 1 floor t 2 table t 1 table b 2 c 2 bowl cup b 1 bowl c 1 cup on on on on in in (a) (b) r 1 rabbit r 2rabbit r 3rabbit r 4 rabbit h 1 hat h 4 hat h 2 hat h 3 hat f 1 flower f 2 flower b 1 bathtub in in in Figure 1: (a) The Dale and Haddock (1991) scenario; (b) the Stone and Webber (1998) scenario. 
One description can be chosen over another, for example, because it fullfills some additional communicative goal (Dale and Reiter 1995, section 2.4; also Stone and Webber 1998). 
Head nouns can also be selected during linguistic realization or by interleaving of content determination and realization (e.g. , Horacek 1997; Stone and Webber 1998; Krahmer and Theune 1999).

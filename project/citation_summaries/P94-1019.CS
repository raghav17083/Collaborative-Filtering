We use eight similarity measures implemented within the WordNet::Similarity package5, described in (Pedersen et al. , 2004); these include three measures derived from the paths between the synsets in WordNet: HSO (Hirst and St-Onge, 1998), LCH (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998), and WUP (Wu and Palmer, 1994); three measures based on information content: RES (Resnik, 1995), LIN (Lin, 1998), and JCN (Jiang and Conrath, 1997); the gloss-based Extended Lesk Measure LESK, (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003), and finally the gloss vector similarity measure VECTOR (Patwardan, 2003). 
Note that Wu and Palmer (1994) designed their measure such that shallow nodes (i.e. , less specific senses) are less similar than nodes that are deeper in the WordNet hierarchy, a property that is lacking in the edge distance measure. 
The Wu & Palmer (Wu and Palmer, 1994) similarity metric measures the depth of two given concepts in the WordNet taxonomy, and the depth of the least common subsumer (LCS), and combines these figures into a similarity score: Simwup = 2depth(LCS)depth(concept 1) + depth(concept2) (3) The measure introduced by Resnik (Resnik, 1995) returns the information content (IC) of the LCS of two concepts: Simres = IC(LCS) (4) where IC is defined as: IC(c) = logP(c) (5) and P(c) is the probability of encountering an instance of concept c in a large corpus. 
We use the similarity measure described in (Wu and Palmer, 1994) which finds the path length to the root node from the least common subsumer (LCS) of the two word senses which is the most specific word sense they share as an ancestor. 
The measures we use include path length based measures (Rada et al. , 1989; Wu & Palmer, 1994; Leacock & Chodorow, 1998), as well as ones based on information content (Resnik, 1995; Jiang & Conrath, 1997; Lin, 1998).

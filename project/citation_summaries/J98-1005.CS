Many standard M L algorithms for supervised learning have been applied, such as: Decision Lists (arowsky, 1994; Agirre and Martinez, 2000), Neural Networks (Towell and Voorhees, 1998), Bayesian learning (Bruce and Wiebe, 1999), Exemplar-Based learning (Ng, 1997a; Fujii et al. , 1998), Boosting (Escudero et al. , 2000a), etc. Unfortunately, there have been very few direct comparisons between alternative methods for WSD. 
The method is applicable not only to nouns but also to adjectives and verbs, since it does not rely on topical context, which is effective only for nouns as pointed out by Towell and Voorhees (1998). 
The line data was recently revisited by both (Towell and Voorhees, 1998) and (Leacock et al. , 1998).

Towell and Voorhees (1998) showed that, given accurate WSD, the lexical relations encoded in lexicons such as WordNet can be exploited to improve the effectiveness of IR systems.

1 Introduction Phrase-based translation models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al. , 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), which go beyond the original IBM translation models (Brown et al. , 1993) 1 by modeling translations of phrases rather than individual words, have been suggested to be the state-of-theart in statistical machine translation by empirical evaluations. 
For example, given a source phrase f and a target phrase e, the phrase pair ( f,e) is said to be consistent (Och and Ney, 2004) with the alignment if and only if: (1) there must be at least one word inside one phrase aligned to a word inside the other phrase and (2) no words inside one phrase can be aligned to a word outside the other phrase. 
2.1 Baseline MT System: Alignment Templates Our baseline MT system is the alignment template system described in detail by Och, Tillmann, and Ney (1999) and Och and Ney (2004). 
We used GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2004) and the heuristics grow-diag-final to generate m-to-n word alignments. 
1 Introduction Phrase-based statistical machine translation models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn, 2004; Koehn et al., 2007) have achieved significant improvements in translation accuracy over the original IBM word-based model.

J98-3005:1	115:614	Techniques for proper noun extraction include the use of regular grammars to delimit and identify proper nouns (Mani et al. 1993; Paik et al. 1994), the use of extensive name lists, place names, titles and "gazetteers" in conjunction with partial grammars in order to recognize proper nouns as unknown words in close proximity to known words (Cowie et al. 1992; Aberdeen et al. 1992), statistical training to learn, for example, Spanish names, from on-line corpora (Ayuso 474 Radev and McKeown Generating Natural Language Summaries et al. 1992), and the use of concept-based pattern matchers that use semantic concepts as pattern categories as well as part-of-speech information (Weischedel et al. 1993; Lehnert et al. 1993).

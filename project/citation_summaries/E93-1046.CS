Our previous approach to tagging and morphological disambiguation for Turkish text had employed a constraint-based approach (Oflazer and Kuru6z, 1994) along the general lines of similar previous work for English (Karlsson et al. , 1995; Voutilainen et al. , 1992; Voutilainen and Tapanainen, 1993). 
Another approach is the rule-based or constraint-based approach, recently most prominently exemplified by the Constraint Grammar work (Karlsson et al. , 1995; Voutilainen, 1995b; Voutilainen et al. , 1992; Voutilainen and Tapanainen, 1993), where a large number of hand-crafted linguistic constraints are used to eliminate impossible tags or morphological parses for a given word in a given context. 
The representation is introduced in (Voutilainen and Tapanainen 1993; Voutilainen 1994); here, only the main characteristics are given:  Each word boundary is explicitly represented as one of five alternatives: the sentence boundary "@@" the boundary separating juxtaposed finite clauses "@/" -centre-embedded (sequences of) finite clauses are flanked with "@<" and "@>" the plain word boundary "@"  Each word is furnished with a tag indicating a surface-syntactic function (subject, premoditier, auxiliary, main verb, adverbial, etc.). 
Although finite-state machines have been used for part-of-speech tagging (Tapanainen and Voutilainen 1993; Silberztein 1993), none of these approaches has the same flexibility as stochastic techniques.

The performance of the serially connected spoken QA system, based on the QA system from text input which has 76% performance and the output of the ASR which operated at a 30% WER, was only 7% (Harabagiu et al. , 2002). 
5.2 Results To measure error correction performance, we use word error rate (WER) and term error rate (TER): WER = jSwj + jIwj + jDwjjW truthj (10) TER = jStj + jItj + jDtjjT truthj (11) jWtruthj is the number of original words, and jTtruthj is the number of query term (or keyword) in original words, that is, an error rate of content words directly related to the performance of IR and QA system (Fujii et al. , 2002A). 
1 Introduction Information retrieval systems with spoken language have been studied (Harabagiu et al. , 2002; Hori et al. , 2003). 
First, a morphological analysis is performed, which segments a sentence of words into morphemes, and adds POS tags to the morphemes (Lee et al. , 2002). 
The Dialog Navigator (Kiyota et al. , 2002) was developed in the University of Tokyo as a Table 1: Document set (Knowledge base) Text collection # of texts # of characters Glossary 4,707 700,000 FAQ 11,306 6,000,000 Support articles 23,323 22,000,000 text retrieval system for this knowledge base.

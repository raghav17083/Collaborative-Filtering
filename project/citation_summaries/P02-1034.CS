In (Collins and Duffy, 2002), the tree kernel Tr is used to count the total number of common sub-trees of two parse trees. 
The tree kernel used in this article was proposed in (Collins and Duffy, 2002) for syntactic parsing reranking. 
 can be computed as follows: (1) if the productions (i.e. the nodes with their direct children) at n1 and n2 are different then (n1,n2) = 0; (2) if the productions at n1 and n2 are the same, and n1 and n2 only have leaf children (i.e. they are preterminal symbols) then (n1,n2) = 1; (3) if the productions at n1 and n2 are the same, and n1 and n2 are not pre-terminals then (n1,n2) =producttext nc(n1) j=1 (1+(cjn1,cjn2)), where nc(n1) is the number of children of n1 and cjn is the j-th child of n. Such tree kernel can be normalized and a  factor can be added to reduce the weight of large structures (refer to (Collins and Duffy, 2002) for a complete description). 
1 Introduction In recent years tree kernels have been shown to be interesting approaches for the modeling of syntactic information in natural language tasks, e.g. syntactic parsing (Collins and Duffy, 2002), relation extraction (Zelenko et al. , 2003), Named Entity recognition (Cumby and Roth, 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and Semantic Parsing (Moschitti, 2004). 
The best known kernel for modeling a tree is the tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2002), which argues that a feature vector is implicitly composed of the counts of subtrees.

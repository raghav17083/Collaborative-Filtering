1996) extends this result to the case where Gen(mput) is the set of parse trees for input under some context-free grammar (CFG)3 Tesar's constraints are functions on parse trees such tha~ Ci(\[A \[B1 \] \[B~.-.\]\]) can be computed from A, B:, B2, Ci(B1), and Ci(B~.).


A similar argument for weighted CFGs (using two tones) shows this constraint to be too hard even for (Tesar, 1996).

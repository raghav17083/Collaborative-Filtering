Worse still, it is hard to write rules for some grammatical errors, for example, detecting errors concerning the articles and singular plural usage (Nagata et al. , 2006). 
The work in (Nagata et al. , 2006) focuses on a type of error, namely mass vs. count nouns. 
To date, single human annotation has typically been the gold standard for grammatical error detection, such as in the work of (Izumi et al., 2004), (Han et al., 2006), (Nagata et al., 2006), (Eeg-Olofsson and Knuttson, 2003)2. 
Some researchers explicitly focus on individual classes of er93 rors, e.g., mass vs count nouns in (Brockett et al. , 2006) and (Nagata et al. , 2006). 
More recently, data-driven approaches have gained popularity and been applied to article prediction in English (Knight and Chander 1994; Minnen et al, 2000; Turner and Charniak 2007), to an array of Japanese learners errors in English (Izumi et al, 2003), to verb errors (Lee and Seneff, 2008), and to article and preposition correction in texts written by non-native ELLs (Han et al, 2004, 2006; Nagata et al, 2005; Nagata et al, 2006; De Felice and Pulman, 2007; Chodorow et al, 2007; Gamon et al, 2008, 2009; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008a).

Sentiment analysis includes a variety of different problems, including: sentiment classification techniques to classify reviews as positive or negative, based on bag of words (Pang et al. , 2002) or positive and negative words (Turney, 2002; Mullen and Collier, 2004); classifying sentences in a document as either subjective or objective (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004); identifying or classifying appraisal targets (Nigam and Hurst, 2004); identifying the source of an opinion in a text (Choi et al. , 2005), whether the author is expressing the opinion, or whether he is attributing the opinion to someone else; and developing interactive and visual opinion mining methods (Gamon et al. , 2005; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005). 
There are also research work on automatically classifying movie or product reviews as positive or negative (Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Mullen and Collier, 2004; Beineke et al. , 2004; Pang and Lee, 2004; Hu and Liu, 2004). 
(2002), various classification models and linguistic features have been proposed to improve the classification performance (Pang and Lee, 2004; Mullen and Collier, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005a; Read, 2005). 
Another method is to use proximal information of the query and the word, using syntactic structure such as dependency relations of words that provide the graphical representation of the text (Mullen and Collier, 2004). 
Research on the automatic classification of movie or product reviews as positive or negative (e.g. , (Pang et al. , 2002; Morinaga et al. , 2002; Turney and Littman, 2003; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Mullen and Collier, 2004; Beineke et al. , 2004; Hu and Liu, 2004)) is perhaps the most similar to our work.

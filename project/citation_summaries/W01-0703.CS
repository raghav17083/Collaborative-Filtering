Third, there is scope for building on existing work on learning selectional preferences for WSD and the resolution of syntactic ambiguity; we suspect that, in particular, the work on learning class-to-class selectional preferences by (Agirre and Martinez, 2001) may be useful here. 
Among others we can mention eXtended WordNet (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001), large collections of semantic preferences acquired from SemCor (Agirre and Martinez, 2001; Agirre and Martinez, 2002) or acquired from British National Corpus (BNC) (McCarthy, 2001), largescale Topic Signatures for each synset acquired from the web (Agirre and de la Calle, 2004) or acquired from the BNC (Cuadros et al. , 2005). 
 spSemCor (Agirre and Martinez, 2001; Agirre and Martinez, 2002): This knowledge resource contains the selectional preferences acquired from SemCor. 
Among others we can mention eXtended WordNet (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001), large collections of semantic preferences acquired from SemCor (Agirre and Martinez, 2001; Agirre and Martinez, 2002) or acquired from British National Corpus (BNC) (McCarthy, 2001), largescale Topic Signatures for each synset acquired from the web (Agirre and de la Calle, 2004) or acquired from the BNC (Cuadros et al. , 2005). 
4 A recent paper that extends the acquisition of selectional preferences to sense-sense relationships is Agirre and Martinez (2001).

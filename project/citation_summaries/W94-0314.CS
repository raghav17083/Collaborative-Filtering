I have implemented a database query system in Prolog, described in (Hoffman, 1994), which uses Multiset CCG to interpret and gen: crate Turkish sentences with context-appropriate word orders. 
(Prevost and Steedman, 1993; Hoffman, 1994) represent syntax, semantics and pragmatics in a lexicalized framework, but concentrate on information structure rather than the pragmatics of particular constructions. 
Even though in written texts the constituent order predominantly conforms to the SOV order,constituents may freely change their position depending on the requirements of the discourse context (Erguvanl 1979; Hoffman 1994). 
(Prevost and Steedman, 1993; Hoffman, 1994) do represent the division of sentences into theme and rheme, but because they do not model the pragmatics of particular constructions, they plan descriptions in a separate step. 
For example, (Hoffman, 1994) proposes a treatment of WO in Turkish using a categorial grammar framework (CCG, (Steedman, 2000)) and relating this to Steedmans (earlier) account of information structure (Steedman, 1991).

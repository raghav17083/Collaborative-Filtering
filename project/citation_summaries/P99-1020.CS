Mihalcea and Moldovan (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 1999) use the semantic density between words to determine the word sense. 
Mihalcea and Moldovan [1999], in an analogous context, use the logarithm of the number of terms in a given terms subtree to calculate weights, and they claim to have shown that this function is optimal. 
Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999) and Agirre and Martinez (2000) use the Web for word sense disambiguation, Volk (2001) proposes a method for resolving PP attachment ambiguities based on Web data, Markert, Nissim, and Modjeska (2003) use the Web for the resolution of nominal anaphora,  School of Informatics, 2 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh EH8 9LW, UK. 
Rada Mihalcea and Dan Moldovan (1999) used hit counts for carefully constructed search engine queries to identify rank orders for word sense frequencies, as an input to a word sense disambiguation engine. 
This does not seem to cause problems with VA very often  indeed the co-occurrence calculations that we perform are similar to those done by [Mihalcea and Moldovan, 1999] to perform word sense disambiguation  but it can give rise to amusing results.

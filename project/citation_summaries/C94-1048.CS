Correct translation pairs are selected by means of inverse consultation, a method that relies on counting the number of pivot language definitions of the source word, through which the target language definitions can be identified (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994). 
First, a one-time look up method (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994) is tried using K)E and J)E. Second, an overlapping constraint method in one direction is applied using K)E and E)J. Finally, a novel combination for building a dictionary is attempted using E)K and E)J. We found that the best result is obtained by the rst method. 
Production of new dictionaries, even only crude drafts, from available ones, has been much less treated, and it seems that no general computational framework has been proposed (see eg, Byrd & al (1987), Tanaka & Umemura (1994), Dorr & al (1995)). 
Pivot language based bilingual dictionary generation is one plausible such alternative (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994; Sjbergh, 2005; Shirai and Yamamoto, 2001; Bond and Ogura, 2007). 
2 Conventional Methods and Problems The basic method of generating a bilingual dictionary through an intermediate language was proposed by Tanaka and Umemura (1994).

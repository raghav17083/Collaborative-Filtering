Such coarse-grained inventories can be produced manually from scratch (Hovy et al., 2006) or by automatically relating (McCarthy, 2006) or clustering (Navigli, 2006; Navigli et al., 2007) existing word senses. 
Due to a lack of interannotator agreement data for this dataset, (McCarthy, 2006) performed an annotation study using three labelers on a 20-noun subset of the SENSEVAL-2 groupings; the three labelers were given the task of deciding whether the 351 potentially-related sense pairs were Related, Unrelated, or Dont Know.3 In this task the pair2In order to facilitate future work in this area, we have made cleaned versions of these groupings available at http://ai.stanford.edu/rion/swn along with a diff with the original files. 
A number of natural language tasks such as machine translation (Lopez, 2008) and word sense disambiguation (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003; McCarthy, 2006), can be framed as semantic distance problems. 
A wide variety of semantic and syntactic criteria were used to produce the SENSEVAL-2 groupings (Palmer et al. , 2004; Palmer et al. , 2005); this data covers all senses of 411 nouns, 519 verbs, and 257 adjectives, and has been used as gold standard sense clustering data in previous work (Agirre and Lopez, 2003; McCarthy, 2006)2. 
Finally, McCarthy (2006) proposes the use of ranked lists, based on distributionally nearest neighbours, to relate word senses.

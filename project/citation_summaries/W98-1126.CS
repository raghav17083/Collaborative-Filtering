4 There are many other features to investigate in future work, such as features based on tags assigned to previous utterances (see, e.g., (Wiebe et al. , 1997; Samuel et al. , 1998)), and features based on semantic classes, such as positive and negative polarity adjectives (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) and reporting verbs (Bergler, 1992). 
When formulating the features SimilarColl and DictColl, the words related to each context word are considered as potential collocations (Wiebe et al. , 1998). 
5 Machine Learning Results Recently, there have been many successful applications of machine learning to discourse processing, such as (Litman, 1996; Samuel et al. , 1998). 
6.3 Uniqueness Based on previous work (Wiebe et al. , 1998), we hypothesized that low-frequency words are associated with subjectivity.Table 6 provides evidence that the number of unique words (words that appear just once) in subjective elements is higher than expected. 
These questions are particularly important in news reporting, in which segments presenting opinions and verbal reactions are mixed with segments presenting objective fact (van Dijk, 1988; Kan et al. , 1998).

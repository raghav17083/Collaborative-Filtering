Some of these methods make use of prior knowledge in the form of an existing thesaurus (Resnik 1993a, 1993b; Framis 1994; Almuallim et al. 1994; Tanaka 1996; Utsuro and Matsumoto 1997), while others do not rely on any prior knowledge (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Grishman and Sterling 1994; Tanaka 1994).

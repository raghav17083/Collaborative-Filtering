Also, according to (BRILL and SORICUT, 2004), BLEU is a good representative of a class of automatic evaluation methods with the focus on precision6. 
933 Recently, Soricut and Brill (2004) employed ngram co-occurrences to evaluate question answering in a FAQ domain; unfortunately, the task differs from definition question answering, making their resultsnotdirectlyapplicable. 
Preferred functions are various combinations of precision and recall (Soricut and Brill, 2004), including 1Since existing evaluation metrics (e.g. BLEU, ROUGE) are special cases of our metric family, it is only natural to name it Broad Learning and Adaptation for Numeric Criteria (BLANC)  white light contains light of all frequencies 740 weighted precision and F-measures (Van-Rijsbergen, 1979). 
Recently, researchers have started automatic question answering evaluation (Xu et al. , 2004; Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2005; Soricut and Brill, 2004).

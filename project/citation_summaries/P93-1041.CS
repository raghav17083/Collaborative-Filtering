A lot of research has been done on text segmentation (Kozima, 1993; Hearst, 1994; Okumura and Honda, 1994; Salton et al. , 1996; Yaari, 1997; Kan et al. , 1998; Choi, 2000; Nakao, 2000). 
2.2 Lexical cohesion (Kozima, 1993) employs a "lexical cohesion profile" to keep track of the semantic cohesiveness of words in a text within a fixed-length window. 
Embodiments of this idea include semantic similarity (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Kozima, 1993), cosine similarity in word vector space (Hearst, 1994), inter-sentence similarity matrix (Reynar, 1994; Choi, 2000), entity repetition (Kan et al. , 1998), word frequency models (Reynar, 1999), or adaptive language models (Beeferman et al. , 1999). 
But work such as (Kozima, 1993), (Ferret, 1998) or (Kaufmann, 1999) showed that using a domainindependent source of knowledge for text segmentation doesnt necessarily lead to get better results than work that is only based on word distribution in texts. 
Kozima (1993), for example, used cohesion based on the spreading activation on a semantic network.

The procedure could easily be modified to account for other constraints on the way derivation should proceed such as those suggested for LTAGs (Schabes and Shieber, 1992).


2  We adopt the definition of derivation trees in (Schabes and Shieber, 1992) (which allows multiple adjunction at any node) and require all mod-etrees adjoin to the etree that they modify.

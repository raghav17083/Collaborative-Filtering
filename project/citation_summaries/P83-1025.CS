Empirical observations have shown that users of natural language interfaces employ 132 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 9, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1983 Jaime G. Carbonell and Philip J. Hayes Recovery Strategies for Parsing Extrammatical Language ellipsis and other abbreviating devices (for example, anaphora, short definite noun phrases, cryptic language omitting semantically superfluous words, and lexical abbreviations) with alarming frequency (Carbonell 1983). 
Carbonell (1983) demonstrated this phenomenon in an informal poll in which users were found to interpret the fragment in the following dialog as retaining the fixed media specification. 
Subsequently, case frame instantiation was introduced as the new dominant strategy, and the new system, DYPAR-II, is currently used as the experimental parser for XCALIBUR, a natural language interface to expert systems (Carbonell et al. 1983).

Carbonell(1983) demonstrated this phemonenon in an informal poll in which users were found to interpret the fraRment in the followlng dialogue as retaining the fixed media specification: "What is the size of the 3 largest single port fixed media disks"?

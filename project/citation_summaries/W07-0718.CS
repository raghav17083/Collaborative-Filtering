Finally, when evaluated on the datasets of the recent ACL07 MT workshop (Callison-Burch et al., 2007), our proposed metric achieves higher correlation with human judgements than all of the 11 automatic MT evaluation metrics evaluated during the workshop. 
4.2 Test phrases The test set was the English portion of test sets used in the shared translation task of the ACL2007 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (Callison-Burch et al., 2007). 
This behavior appears to be consistent on the test2007 and nc-test2007 data sets across systems (Callison-Burch et al., 2007). 
4 Re-tuning Meteor for Rankings (Callison-Burch et al., 2007) reported that the intercoder agreement on the task of assigning ranks to a given set of candidate hypotheses is much better than the intercoder agreement on the task of assigning a score to a hypothesis in isolation. 
During the recent ACL-07 workshop on statistical MT (Callison-Burch et al., 2007), a total of 11 automatic MT evaluation metrics were evaluated for correlation with human judgement.

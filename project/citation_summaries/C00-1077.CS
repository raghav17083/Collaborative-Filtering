The notion of term similarity has been defined and considered in different ways: terms can have functional and/or structural similarities, though they can be correlated by different relationships (Grefenstette (1994), Maynard and Ananiadou (2000)). 
In order to discover new knowledge, one has to identify main concepts, which are linguistically represented by domain specific terms (Maynard and Ananiadou (2000)). 
For example, some approaches consider only terms that appear in a close proximity to each other (Maynard and Ananiadou (2000)), while in other approaches, grammatical roles such as object or subject are taken into account (Grefenstette (1994)). 
The identification of concepts, linguistically represented by domain-specific terms (Maynard and Ananiadou, 2000), is a basic step in the automated acquisition of knowledge from textual documents.

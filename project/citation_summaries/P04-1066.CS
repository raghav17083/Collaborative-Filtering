Secondly, the rarely occurring compound word may cause the garbage collectors effect (Moore, 2004; Liang et al., 2006), aligning a rare word in source language to too many words in the target language, due to the frequency imbalance with the corresponding translation words in English (Lee, 2004). 
this example, COJO is a rare word that becomes a garbage collector (Moore, 2004) for the models in both directions. 
In the work of Moore (2004a) and Melamed (2000), two words cooccur if they are present in a pair of aligned sentences in the parallel training corpus. 
Due to its simplicity, this model has several shortcomings, some more structural than others (see Moore [2004] for a discussion). 
2.2 Using Log-Likelihood-Ratios to Estimate Word Translation Probabilities Our method for computing the probabilistic translation lexicon LLR-Lex is based on the the Log2http://www.fjoch.com/GIZA++.html Likelihood-Ratio (LLR) statistic (Dunning, 1993), which has also been used by Moore (2004a; 2004b) and Melamed (2000) as a measure of word association.

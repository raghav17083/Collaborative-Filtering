(Niwa and Nitta, 1994) compare dictionary based vectors with cooccurrence based vectors, where the vector of a word is the probability that an origin word occurs in the context of the word. 
(1990) (based on dictionary entries), Gallant (1991) (based on hand-encoded semantic features), Grefenstette (1994b) (based on light parsing), and Niwa and Nitta (1994) (a comparison of dictionary-based and corpus-based context vectors). 
Other methods use a variety of other information: cooccurrence of two words (Burgess, 1998; Schutze, 1998), occurrence of a word in the sense definitions of a dictionary (Kasahara et al. , 1997; Niwa and Nitta, 1994) or word association norms (Steyvers et al. , 2004). 
(1994), Niwa and Nitta (1994), Lehman (1994), among others. 
Various corpus-based approaches to word sense disambiguation have been proposed (Bruce and Wiebe 1994; Charniak 1993; Dagan and Itai 1994; Fujii et al. 1996; Hearst 1991; Karov and Edelman 1996; Kurohashi and Nagao 1994; Li, Szpakowicz, and Matwin 1995; Ng and Lee 1996; Niwa and Nitta 1994; Sch~itze 1992; Uramoto 1994b; Yarowsky 1995).

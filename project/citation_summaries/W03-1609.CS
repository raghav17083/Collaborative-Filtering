Shinyama and Sekine (2003) presented an approach of extracting paraphrases using names, dates and numbers as anchors. 
By exploiting this feature, one can extract paraphrastic expressions automatically from parallel corpora (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) or comparable corpora (Shinyama and Sekine, 2003). 
There are many previous work on paraphrase examples extraction or combining them with some applications such as information retrieval and question answering (Agichtein et al. , 2001; Florence et al. , 2003; Rinaldi et al. , 2003; Tomuro, 2003; Lin and Pantel, 2001;), information extraction (Shinyama et al. , 2002; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003), machine translation (Hiroshi et al. , 2003; Zhang and Yamamoto, 2003), multi-document (Barzilay et al. , 2003). 
There is another trend in the research in this field, namely, the automatic acquisition of paraphrase patterns from parallel or comparable corpora (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pang et al. , 2003; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003, etc.). 
The first method is using the Part-of-Speech (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Daum and Marcu, 2003; Zhang and Yamamoto, 2003), the second uses name entity as the variable (Shinyama et al. , 2002; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003), the third method is similar to the second method which is called the inference rules extraction (Lin and Pantel, 2001).

So although it is now possible to extract at least subcategorisation data from large corpora 2 with 2Grishman & Sterling (1992), Poznanski & Sanfilippo (1993), Resnik (1993), Pdbas (1994), McCarthy (1997) and others have shown that it is possible also to a119 some degree of reliability, it would be difficult to integrate the data into this type of parsing system. 
In (Schubert, 2002) we made some comparisons between our project and earlier work in knowledge extraction (e.g. , (muc, 1993; muc, 1995; muc, 1998; Berland and Charniak, 1999; Clark and Weir, 1999; Hearst, 1998; Riloff and Jones, 1999)) and in discovery of selectional preferences (e.g. , (Agirre and Martinez, 2001; Grishman and Sterling, 1992; Resnik, 1992; Resnik, 1993; Zernik, 1992; Zernik and Jacobs, 1990)). 
(%) (%) 'Baseline' 57.2 1.11 82.5 83.0 With subcat 56.6 1.10 83.1 83.1 Table 2: Bracketing evaluation measures, before and after incorporation of subcat information and zero crossings, the percentage of sentences for which the analysis returned has zero crossings (see Grishman, Macleod & Sterling, 1992). 
Grishman & Sterling (1992), Poznanski & Sanfilippo (1993), Resnik (1993), Ribas (1994) and others have shown that it is possible to acquire selection preferences from (partially) parsed data. 
For the extraction problem, there have been various methods proposed to date, which are quite adequate (Hindle and Rooth 1991; Grishman and Sterling 1992; Manning 1992; Utsuro, Matsumoto, and Nagao 1992; Brent 1993; Smadja 1993; Grefenstette 1994; Briscoe and Carroll 1997).

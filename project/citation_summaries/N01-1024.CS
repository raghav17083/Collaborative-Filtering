1 Introduction Unsupervised morphology acquisition attempts to learn from raw corpora one or more of the following about the written morphology of a language: (1) the segmentation of the set of word types in a corpus (Creutz and Lagus, 2007), (2) the clustering of word types in a corpus based on some notion of morphological relatedness (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000), (3) the generation of out-of-vocabulary items which are morphologically related to other word types in the corpus (Yarowsky et al., 2001). 
Schone and Jurafsky (2001) use latent semantic analysis to find prefixes, suffixes and circumfixes in German, Dutch and English. 
(Some of the most recent work such as (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001) and (Goldsmith, 2001b) are notable exceptions to this paradigm). 
Next along the spectrum of orthographic similarity bias is the work of Schone and Jurafsky (2000; 2001), who first acquire a list of potential morphological variants using an orthographic similarity technique due to Gaussier (1999) in which pairs of words with the same initial string are identified. 
A somewhat tighter definition of co-occurrence, which nevertheless yields a semantic distance measure, serves as the basis of a method that captures irregular inflectional transformations in Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2001).1 Schone and Jurafsky (2001) employ distributions over adjacent words (yielding a syntactic distance metric) to improve the precision of their conflation sets.

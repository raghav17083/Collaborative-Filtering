Various machine learning approaches such as ME (Kazama et al. , 2002), SVM (Kazama et al. , 2002; Song et al. , 2004), HMM (Zhao, 2004) are applied to NER. 
This feature has been widely used in the biomedical domain (Kazama et al 2002; Shen et al 2003; Zhou et al 2004). 
Kazama et al 2002 applies SVM and incorporates a rich feature set, including word feature, POS, prefix feature, suffix feature, previous class feature, word cache feature and HMM state feature. 
There are some research efforts using machine learning techniques to recognize biological entities in texts (Takeuchi and Collier, 2002; Kim and Tsujii, 2002; Kazama et al. , 2002). 
Since in previous work, many NER systems have been applied successfully in newswire domain (Zhou and Su 2002; Bikel et al. 1999; Borthwich et al. 1999), more and more explorations have been done to port existing NER system into biomedical domain (Kazama et al. 2002; Takeuchi et al. 2002; Nobata et al. 1999 and 2000; Collier et al. 2000; Gaizauskas et al. 2000; Fukuda et al. 1998; Proux et al. 1998).

(Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) have utilized a tree kernel method to calculate the similarity between T and H, and (Wang and Neumann, 2007) chose subsequence kernel to reduce the computational complexity.


4.2 Tree Skeleton The Tree Skeleton (TS) structure was proposed by (Wang and Neumann, 2007), and can be viewed as an extended version of the predicate-argument structure.

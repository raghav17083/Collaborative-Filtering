Our notion of text grammar has served us well in previous work on military message corpora, as describe d in our system summary in these proceedings . Detailed descriptions of the text grammars for two Air Forc e corpora are contained in Montgomery and Glover [25] and in Stalls et al . [29] . For MUC3, however, text grammar rules were implemented in the DBG (Data Base Generator) system only at the message level a t the time of final testing (May 1991), since our resources had been focused on a major redevelopment o f the grammar and parsing mechanism to a syntactic analyzer based on Government Binding principles (a s described in our system summary and site report in these proceedings) . The DBG system output for the processing of each message is a text level knowledge representation fo r the message content consisting of a set of instantiated event and object frames called templates . 7 This set of templates is an instantiation of the text grammar that reflects the structure and content of the given message . 7It is important to note that the term template in the DBG system is a label for the generic message level semantic andpragmatic representational units, not an application-oriented structure like the MUC templates . The DBG templates are the glass box output or internal representational output, as opposed to the MUC templates, which are black box outputs mappe d to the external representation required by a given application : currently, extraction of specific data elements for describin gterrorist incidents in 9 Latin American countries . 265 The information contained in these internal templates is then mapped to the external application-oriente d data structures, in this case the MUC-3 templates . The first internal template generated by our system is a Report template . The Report template is a `meta template', which considers the message itself as a reporting event over and above the actual event s described in the message . Such header information can be extremely complex, as in military messages fo r the air activity and space event domains (see our system summary and references) . The header may eve n supply information assumed, but not provided explicitly within the accompanying message text, such a s specific equipment designations, which are referred to only by generic names in the text . Because our text grammar for MUC-3 was only partially implemented at the time of testing, just a few of the report attributes identified (e.g. , date of the report and country of the reporting source) were actually recorded in the Report templates . In addition to header slots containing information about the reporting event itself, the Report template contains a set of slots that point to the internal (DBG) event/action templates generated for the text . These slots may be qualified by attributes reflecting degree of certitude concerning the event pointed to (e .g. , `probable', `possible', `apparently', etc ). 
The interpretation of the ATT$ utterances is performed in the logical language imposed by the implementation in the DELPHI system (Bobrow et al. , 1991). 
Introduction Formalisms equivalent to, or based on, unification grammars of the type exemplified by PATR (Shieber 1984) are very widely used in computational linguistics (Alshawi 1992; van Noord et al. 1990; Briscoe et al. 1987; Bobrow, Ingria, and Stallard 1991, etc).

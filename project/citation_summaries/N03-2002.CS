Our model, Equation 1, is different from most language modeling systems since our models condition on both previous words and another potential factor A. Such a model is easily represented using a factored language model (FLM), an idea introduced in (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003; Kirchhoff et al. , 2003), and incorporated into the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002). 
To improve their estimates, factored language models (FLMs) are used along with generalized parallel backoff (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003). 
OpenCCG implements a symbolic-statistical chartrealizationalgorithm(Kay, 1996; Carrolletal., 1999; White, 2006b) combining (1) a theoretically groundedapproachtosyntaxandsemanticcomposition with (2) factored language models (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003) for making choices among the options left open by the grammar. 
Moses is also able to integrate factored language models, such as those described in (Bilmes and Kirchhoff 2003) and (Axelrod 2006). 
All training of language models is done using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) with the FLM extensions (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003), and the implementation and testing of the various graphical models is carried out with the help of the graphical models toolkit (GMTK) (Bilmes and Zweig, 2002).

Other methods do not depend on word alignments only, such as directly modeling phrase alignment in a joint generative way (Marcu and Wong, 2002), pursuing information extraction perspective (Venugopal et al., 2003), or augmenting with modelbased phrase pair posterior (Deng and Byrne, 2005). 
Many researchers (e.g., (Venugopal et al., 2003; Deng et al., 2008)) observe that softening the alignment consistency constraint help improve translation quality. 
Among the applications of Model 1 are segmenting long sentences into subsentental units for improved word alignment (Nevado et al. , 2003), extracting parallel sentences from comparable corpora (Munteanu et al. , 2004), bilingual sentence alignment (Moore, 2002), aligning syntactictree fragments (Ding et al. , 2003), and estimating phrase translation probabilities (Venugopal et al. , 2003). 
1 Introduction In recent years, phrase-based systems for statistical machine translation (Och et al. , 1999; Koehn et al. , 2003; Venugopal et al. , 2003) have delivered state-of-the-art performance on standard translation tasks. 
5 Discussions The generic phrase training algorithm follows an information retrieval perspective as in (Venugopal et al., 2003) but aims to improve both precision and recall with the trainable log-linear model.

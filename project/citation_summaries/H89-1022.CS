Input to the KOMET/Penman text generation system is given in terms of the Sentence Plan Language (Kasper, 1989), of which we will see examples below. 
Future directions Following from earlier experiments in the integration of Machine Translation (MT) and text generation (Bateman, Kasper, Schlitz, and Steiner, 1989), we have found that the combination of two components of the Systemic-Functional Linguistic (SFL) model of language (Halliday, 1985; Matthiessen, 1987), such as are being developed for computational use within the PENMAN text generation system, significantly reduces tlhe need for structural transfer in machine translation (MT) without requiring deep modelling of specific domains. 
SemSpec The level of SemSpecs is motivated by the notion of "upper modelling" \[Bateman et al. 1990\] and is a subset of the input representation language that was developed for Penman, the sentence plan language (SPL) \[Kasper 1989\]. 
This is limited to 'reifying' the relations and labeling them with 'instance variables' as commonly done in input expressions for generation systems (Kasper, 1989). 
The upper model supports specifications of sentence 'meaning' that may serve as input to a text generation system (Kasper, 1989a), or as output from an analysis component (Kasper, 1989b).

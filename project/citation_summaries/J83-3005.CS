The NOMAD system used procedures associated with individual words and so was very hard to extend (Granger 1983, p. 195); the VOX system remedied some of these defects but used a "conceptual grammar" mixing syntactic and semantic constraints (Meyers 1985). 
This is the case for data base query (our current application), for command systems (such as MURPHY (Selfridge 1986)), and for message entry systems (such as NOMAD (Granger 1983) and VOX (Meyers 1985)). 
The interest in the 80's begun to turn considering grammar checking as an enterprise of its own right (Carbonell & Hayes, 1983), (Ilayes & Mouradian, 1981), (Heidorn et al. , 1982), (.lensen at al. , 1983), though many of the approaches were still in I;t1(: NLU tradition ((\]harniak, 198a), (Granger, 1983), (Kwasny & Sondheimer, 1981), (Weischedel & Black, \]980), (Weisehedel & Sondheimer, 1983). 
Other approaches, such as the NOMAD system (Granger 1984), and those reported by Wilks (1976) and Fass and Wilks (1983), are also related to the approach taken in this paper. 
(Granger, 1983) uses expectations generated by scripts to anMyze unknown words.

Dependency models (Rosenfeld, 2000) use the parsed dependency structure of sentences to build the language model as in grammatical trigrams (Lafferty et al., 1992), structured language models (Chelba and Jelinek, 2000), and dependency language models (Chelba et al., 1997). 
Illustrative clusterings of this type can also be found in Pereira, Tishby, and Lee (1993), Brown, Della Pietra, Mercer, Della Pietra, and Lai (1992), Kneser and Ney (1993), and Brill et al. 
It is sometimes assumed that estimates of entropy (e.g. , Shannon's estimate that English is 75% redundant, Brown et al's (1992) upper bound of 1.75 bits per character for printed English) are directly 3There are some cases where words are deliberately misspelled in order to get better output from the synthesizer, such as coyote spelled kiote. 
Successful approaches aimed at trying to overcome the sparse data limitation include backoff (Katz 1987), Turing-Good variants (Good 1953; Church and Gale 1991), interpolation (Jelinek 1985), deleted estimation (Jelinek 1985; Church and Gale 1991), similarity-based models (Dagan, Pereira, and Lee 1994; Essen and Steinbiss 1992), Pos-language models (Derouault and Merialdo 1986) and decision tree models (Bahl et al. 1989; Black, Garside, and Leech 1993; Magerman 1994). 
Much research has been carried out recently in this area (Hughes and Atwell 1994; Finch and Chater 1994; Redington, Chater, and Finch 1993; Brill et al. 1990; Kiss 1973; Pereira and Tishby 1992; Resnik 1993; Ney, Essen, and Kneser 1994; Matsukawa 1993).

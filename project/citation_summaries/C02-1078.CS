The table also shows Sekis scores for reference, but it is not fair to compare our scores with Sekis scores directly because our data is slightly different from Sekis. The number of zeros in general in our data is 347, while Seki resolved 355 detected zeros in (Seki et al. , 2002a) and 404 in (Seki et al. , 2002b). 
On the other hand, the existing machine learning-based methods (Aone and Bennett, 1995; McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Seki et al., 2002; Isozaki and Hirao, 2003; Iida et al., 2005; Iida et al., 2007a, etc.) have been developed with less attention given to such a problem. 
The number of zeros in our editorial is 514, while (Seki et al. , 2002a) resolved 498 detected zeros. 
have been successfully incorporated in machine learning-based frameworks (Seki et al. , 2002; Iida et al. , 2003).

A degradation in score (with a fluent original sentence) can indicate that the rephrasing segment should be adapted to the sentence, and/or that the sentence itself should be modified in order to integrate the new phrase as is. Syntax parsers can produce various information that can be relevant for assessing the fluency of sentences, which can be used as features from different parsers for classification that can correlate well with human judgment (Mutton et al., 2007). 
s(p2,p1,C) = summationdisplay mM mhm(p1,p2,C) (2) 3.1 Control over fluency As noted by (Mutton et al., 2007), the notion of sentence-level fluency is not uniformely agreed upon, and its evaluation by human judges is sometimes found subjective, but in practice judges can obtain high levels of agreement about what can be considered fluent or not. 
3We intend to use several parsers for English implementing different approaches as in (Mutton et al., 2007), but we had access to only one parser for French. 
The idea is extended in (Mutton et al., 2007), where four parsers are used 139 and artificially generated sentences with varying level of fluency are evaluated with impressive success. 
6.2 Varying Training Data In particular in (Mutton et al., 2007) the training data used human sentences as positive exemplars and very simple bigram-generated sentences as negative ones, so that there was a big difference in quality between them.

2 http://www.google.com/ The first rule is based on Japanese linguistic patterns typically used for term descriptions, such as X toha Y dearu (X is Y). Following the method proposed by Fujii and Ishikawa (2000), we semi-automatically produced 20 patterns based on the Japanese CDROM World Encyclopedia (Heibonsha, 1998), which includes approximately 80,000 entries related to various fields. 
For problems (a) and (b), Fujii and Ishikawa (2000) proposed an automatic method to extract term descriptions from the Web. 
To resolve this problem, we previously used a language model to filter out descriptions with low perplexity (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2000). 
In principle, the remaining two modules (retrieval and extraction) are the same as proposed by Fujii and Ishikawa (2000).

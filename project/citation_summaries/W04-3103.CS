In baseline 1, we use the 14 strings identified in (Light et al., 2004) and classify all the keywords in the test set that match any of them as real speculation keywords. 
Previous studies (Light et al., 2004) showed that the detection of hedging can be solved effectively by looking for specific keywords which imply speculative content. 
Baseline 2 is similar to baseline 1, with the difference that rather than using the set of strings in (Light et al., 2004), we extract the set of keywords from the training set and classify all the words (or phrases) in the test set that match any of the keywords in the list as real speculation keywords. 
Previous studies (Light et al., 2004) showed that the detection of hedging can be solved effectively by looking for specific keywords which imply that the content of a sentence is speculative and constructing simple expert rules that describe the circumstances of where and how a keyword should appear. 
Only the substring matching approach that was introduced in (Light et al., 2004) could be adapted as a keyword classification task, since the substrings are keywords themselves and we used this approach as a baseline in the keyword classification sub-problem.

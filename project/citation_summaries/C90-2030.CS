Dependency grammar (DG) takes as fundamental ~This approach of 'normal form parsing' has been applied to the associative Lambek calculus in (K6nig, 1989), (Hepple, 1990), (Hendriks, 1992), and to Combinatory Categorial Grammar in (Hepple & Morrill, 1989), (Eisner, 1996). 
See K6nig (1989), Hepple (1990) and Moortgat (1990). 
From the parsing perspective, the redundancy of analyses can be controlled by (1) grammar rewriting (Wittenburg 1987), (2) checking the chart for PAS equivalence (Karttunen 1989; Komagata 1997), (3) making the processor parsimonious on using long-distance compositions (Pareschi and Steedman 1987), or (4) parsing into normal forms (Eisner 1996; Hepple 1990b; Hepple and Morrill 1989; Konig 1989; Morrill 1999). 
See Hepple (1990), Morrill (1990) and Moortgat (1990b). 
For example, composition as above has the following alternative derivation: (15) A=~A B~B \L A,A\B ~ B C ~ C A,A\B, B\C =~ C A\B,B\C =~ A\C \R \C One approach to this problem consists in defining, within the Cut-free atomic-id space, normal form derivations in which the succession of rule application is regulated (K6nig 1989, Hepple 1990, Hendriks 1993).

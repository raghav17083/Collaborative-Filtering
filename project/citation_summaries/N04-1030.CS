Using this intuition, state-of-the-art systems first build a parse tree, and syntactic constituents are then labeled by feeding hand-built features extracted from the parse tree to a machine learning system, e.g. the ASSERT system (Pradhan et al. , 2004). 
It is generally formulated as a semantic role labeling (SRL) task, where each argument of the predicate is assigned a label that represents the semantic role it plays with regard to its predicate (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Hacioglu et al. , 2003; Pradhan et al. , 2004b; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Toutanova et al. , 2005; Koomen et al. , 2005). 
The standard features at the top of the table were defined by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and the rest are other useful lexical and structural features identified in more recent work (Pradhan et al. , 2004; Surdeanu et al. , 2003; Xue and Palmer, 2004). 
In our experiments we use the ASSERT parser (Pradhan et al. , 2004), an SVM based semantic role tagger which uses a full syntactic analysis to automatically identify all verb predicates in a sentence together with their semantic arguments, which are output as PropBank arguments (Palmer et al. , 2005).

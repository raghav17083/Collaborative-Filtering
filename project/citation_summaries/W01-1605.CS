3 Corpus Study The generator is informed by a corpus study of embedded discourse units on two discourse annotated corpora: the RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2001) and the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB8 Elab-add Example Elab-gen-spec Restatement Elab-set-mem Attrib ution Condition Antithesis Concession Circumstance Purpose NP-modifiers relative clause 143 2 2 147 participialclause 96 4 1 1 11 4 117 NP 34 8 22 64 NP-coord 6 6 cue+NP 5 1 2 3 2 13 Adj+cue 2 2 number 2 2 including+NP 13 5 18 VPorSmodifiers to-infinitive 4 30 34 NP+V 106 106 cue+S 5 20 14 9 29 77 PP 11 9 1 21 S 7 1 1 9 accordingtoNP 7 7 V+NP 6 6 as+S 4 4 Adv+number 1 1 2 cue+Adj 2 2 cue+participial 2 2 cue+V 1 1 310 19 11 22 14 125 20 18 12 54 35 640 Table 1: Syntactic types of parentheticals in the RST corpus Relation Connective in parenthetical Connective in host distribution in corpus TEMPORAL 101 (48.8%) 2 3434 (18.6%) CONTINGENCY 53 (25.6%) 0 3286 (17.8%) COMPARISON 38 (18.3%) 5 5490 (29.7%) EXPANSION 15 (7.2%) 5 6239 (33.8%) TOTAL: 207 12 18484 Table 2: Relations between parentheticals and their hosts in the PDTB Group, 2008).2 The aim of the study was to establish what rhetorical relations can hold between parentheticals and their hosts and whether individual rhetorical relations tend to correlate with specific syntactic types. 
Other work uses human-annotated corpora, such as the RST Bank (Carlson et al. , 2001), used by Soricut and Marcu (2003), the GraphBank (Wolf and Gibson, 2005), used by Wellner et al. 
(See (Carlson et al. , 2001) for details concerning the corpus and the annotation process).

In the past, subsections of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) have been annotated for discourse relations (Carlson et al., 2001; Wolf and Gibson, 2005).

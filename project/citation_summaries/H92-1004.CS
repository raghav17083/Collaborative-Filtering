The speech understanding community is quite active in refining evaluation measures and in developing new ones (see e.g., Price et al. 1992, Hirschman et al. 1993, Dahl et al. 1994). 
Speech Recognition For several years, the best performing speech recognition systems have been based on statistical pattern matching techniques (Pallett et al. 1990, Pallett 1991, Pallett et al. 1992, Pallett et al. 1993, Pallett et al. 1994). 
However, the integration gives rise to some new areas as well: how can an NL component deal with spontaneous speech effects such as false starts and repairs and how can a speech component send information l.o help the NL component (see e.g., Bear et al. 19.q2, Shriberg et al. 1992), how can techniques from the two component areas be effectively combined, and how can prosodic information be effectively communicated between the two components (see, e.g., Price and Ostendorf 1994 for survey). 
There is also much current work using other pattern matching techniques (see, e.g., Ostendorf and Roukos 1989, Zue et al. 1992), including neural network-based approaches (see e.g., Hampshire and Weibel 1990) and hybrid HMM/neural network approaches (see e.g., Abrash et al. 1994). 
The results can be disastrous for applications, since when a recognizer misrecognizes, a common reaction is to hyperarticulate (Shriberg et al 1992).

In a preliminary study (Chang and Lai, 2004), some probabilistic models had been developed to handle this problem by applying the models to a parallel corpus of compound words and their abbreviations, without knowing the context of the abbreviation pairs. 
Clearly, their method is supervised because it requires the full-abbreviation relations as training data.5 Chang and Teng (2006) extends the work in Chang and Lai (2004) to automatically extract the relations between full-form phrases and their abbreviations. 
In this work, we had applied a unified word segmentation model developed in a previous works (Chang and Lai, 2004), which was able to handle the kind of errors introduced by the abbreviation process. 
Recently, Chang and Lai (2004), Chang and Teng (2006), and Lee (2005) have investigated this task. 
Specifically, Chang and Lai (2004) describes a hidden markov model (HMM) to model the relationship between a full-form phrase and its abbreviation, by treating the abbreviation as the observation and the fullform words as states in the model.

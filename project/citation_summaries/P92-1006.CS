Alhough it is beyond the scope of our research, we conjecture that there exists a Monte Carlo disambiguation algorithm for at least Stochastic Tree-Adjoining Grammar (Schabes, 1992). 
Traditionally it has been seen as a drawback of top-down parsing algorithms such as Earley's that they sacrifice "robustness," i.e., the ability to find partial parses in an ungrammatical input, for the efficiency gained from top-down prediction (Magerman and Weir 1992). 
Briscoe & Carroll, 1992; Black et al. , 1993; Magerman & Weir, 1992; Schabes & Waters, 1993). 
Magerman and Weir (1992) use a similar model with a different parsing algorithm. 
That is, most parsing algorithms assume that the test corpus was generated by the model, and then attempt to evaluate the following expression, where E denotes the expected value operator: Ta = argmTaXE ( 1 ifL = gc) (1) This is true of the Labelled Tree Algorithm and stochastic versions of Earley's Algorithm (Stolcke, 1993), and variations such as those used in Picky parsing (Magerman and Weir, 1992).

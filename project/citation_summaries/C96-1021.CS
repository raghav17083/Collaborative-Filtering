One common approach involves the design of heuristic rules to identify specific types of (non-)anaphoric NPs such as pleonastic pronouns (e.g. , Paice and Husk (1987), Lappin and Leass (1994), Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), Denber (1998)) and definite descriptions (e.g. , Vieira and Poesio (2000)). 
More recently, Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) proposed an algorithm for anaphora resolution that is actually a modified and extended version of the one developed by Lappin and Leass (1994). 
We have slightly m improved the accuracy (83%) in pronominal references to the work of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) (75%), but we have also improved that approach since we automatically 7 It is obvious that we will probably need more semantic information in order to solve these anaphors, but in this paper we are not going to consider this information since the tagger does not provide it. 
Several proposals have already addressed the anaphora resolution problem by deliberately limiting the extent to which they rely on domain and/or linguistic knowledge (Baldwin 1997; Dagan & Itai 1990; Kennedy & Boguraev 1996; Mitkov 1998; Nasukawa 1994; Williams et al. 1996). 
Research in the first category aims to identify specific types of nonanaphoric phrases, with some identifying pleonastic it (using heuristics [e.g., Paice and Husk (1987), Lappin and Leass (1994), Kennedy and Boguraev (1996)], supervised approaches [e.g., Evans (2001), Muller (2006), Versley et al.

This method, as the ones presented in (Vronis, 2003), (Dorow and Widdows, 2003) and (Rapp, 2003), relies on the following hypothesis: in the subgraph gathering the cooccurrents of a word, the number of relations between the cooccurrents defining a sense is higher than the number of relations that these cooccurrents have with those defining the other senses of the considered word. 
Similar to the approach as presented in (Dorow and Widdows, 2003) we construct a word graph. 
The input to a WSI algorithm is a target word to be disambiguated, e.g. 1Sometimes called word sense discovery (Dorow and Widdows, 2003) or word sense discrimination (Purandare, 2004; Velldal, 2005) space, and the output is a number of word sets representing the various senses, e.g. 
The methodology of Dorow and Widdows (2003) was adopted: for the focus word, obtain its graph neighborhood (all vertices that are connected via edges to the focus word vertex and edges between these). 
4 Related Work Besides the two works (Pantel and Lin, 2002; Schutze, 1998), there are other related efforts on word sense discrimination (Dorow and Widdows, 2003; Fukumoto and Suzuki, 1999; Pedersen and Bruce, 1997).

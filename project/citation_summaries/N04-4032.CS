They have subsequently presented an improved model for detecting edits (Johnson et al. , 2004), and our results here complement their analysis of the edit detection and parsing relationship, particularly with respect to the limitations of PCFGs in edit detection. 
Certainly, prosodic cues are useful for sentence segmentation (Liu et al. , 2004), and the quality of automatic segmentation can have a significant impact on parser performance (Kahn et al. , 2004). 
While we are not the first to employ prosodic cues in a statistical parsing model, previous efforts (Gregory et al. , 2004; Kahn et al. , 2004) incorporated these features as word tokens and thereby suffered from the side-effect of displacing words in the n-gram models by the parser. 
Therefore, we evaluated two PCFGs (Bikel, 2004; Charniak and Johnson, 2005) on edit detection and compared their performance to a state-of-the-art TAG-based edit detection system (Johnson et al. , 2004). 
the impact of automatic segmentation is addressed in other work (Kahn et al. , 2004).

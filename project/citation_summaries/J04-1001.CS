It has been shown that one sense per discourse property can improve the performance of bootstrapping algorithm (Li and Li, 2004; Yarowsky, 1995). 
2 Acquisition of Sense Examples Following our previous proposal (Wang, 2004), we automatically acquire English sense examples using large quantities of Chinese text and English-Chinese and Chinese-English dictionaries. 
Ambiguous Accuracies from (Li and Li, 2004) words Major MB-D MB-B BB interest 54.6% 54.7% 69.3% 75.5% line 53.5% 55.6% 54.1% 62.7% Ambiguous Our results words #labeled examples LPcosine LPJS interest 415=60 80.22.0% 79.82.0% line 615=90 60.34.5% 59.43.9% 4.3 Experiment 2: LP vs. Bootstrapping Li and Li (2004) used interest and line corpora as test data. 
Many corpus based statistical methods have been proposed to solve this problem, including supervised learning algorithms (Leacock et al. , 1998; Towel and Voorheest, 1998), weakly supervised learning algorithms (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Li and Li, 2004; Mihalcea, 2004; Niu et al. , 2005; Park et al. , 2000; Yarowsky, 1995), unsupervised learning algorithms (or word sense discrimination) (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997; Schutze, 1998), and knowledge based algorithms (Lesk, 1986; McCarthy et al. , 2004). 
(2004) used cross-lingual lexicalization, wordnets alignment for several languages, and a clustering algorithm to perform WSD on a set of polysemous English words.

An extended version of BLEU which uses n-grams weighted according to their frequency estimated from a monolingual corpus is proposed in (Babych and Hartley, 2004). 
In recent years, many researchers have tried to automatically evaluate the quality of MT and improve the performance of automatic MT evaluations (Niessen et al. , 2000; Akiba et al. , 2001; Papineni et al. , 2002; NIST, 2002; Leusch et al. , 2003; Turian et al. , 2003; Babych and Hartley, 2004; Lin and Och, 2004; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Gimenez et al. , 2005) because improving the performance of automatic MT evaluation is expected to enable us to use and improve MT systems efficiently. 
the study of legitimate translation variation with respect to the BLEU score in (Babych and Hartley, 2004). 
Many methods for calculating the similarity have been proposed (Niessen et al. , 2000; Akiba et al. , 2001; Papineni et al. , 2002; NIST, 2002; Leusch et al. , 2003; Turian et al. , 2003; Babych and Hartley, 2004; Lin and Och, 2004; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Gimenez et al. , 2005). 
This problem is made worse by the fact that Bleu equally weights all items in the reference sentences (Babych and Hartley, 2004).

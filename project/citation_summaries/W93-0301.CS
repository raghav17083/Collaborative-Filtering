Existing lexicon compilation methods (Kupiec 1993; Smadja & McKeown 1994; Kumano & Hirakawa 1994; Dagan et al. 1993; Wu & Xia 1994) all attempt to extract pairs of words or compounds that are translations of each other from previously sentencealigned, parallel texts. 
Related Work The recent availability of large amounts of bilingual data has attracted interest in several areas, including sentence alignment (Gale and Church 1991b; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Simard, Foster and Isabelle 1992; Gale and Church 1993; Chen 1993), word alignment (Gale and Church 1991a; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994; Fung 1995b), alignment of groups of words (Smadja 1992; Kupiec 1993; van der Eijk 1993), and statistical translation (Brown et al. 1993). 
This estimate could be used as a starting point for a more detailed alignment algorithm such as word_align (Dagan et al, 1993). 
Parallel bilingual corpora have been shown to provide a rich source of constraints for statistical analysis (Brown et al. 1990; Gale and Church 1991; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Church 1993; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Department of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong. 
Another kind of popular approaches to dealing with query translation based on corpus-based techniques uses a parallel corpus containing aligned sentences whose translation pairs are corresponding to each other (Brown et al. , 1993; Dagan et al. , 1993; Smadja et al. , 1996).

D09-1071:1	105:228	There is a wealth of evidence (Scott, 2002; Gao and Johnson, 2008) in the machine learning literature that Gibbs sampling for Markov models leads to slow mixing times.
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1071:2	136:228	However, as Gao & Johnson (2008) point out, VI is biased towards clusterings with a small number of clusters.
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1071:3	153:228	Gao & Johnson (2008) partially addressed this issue by mapping states to PoS tags following two different strategies, cross-validation accuracy, and greedy 1-to-1 mapping, which both have shortcomings.
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1071:4	194:228	The closest experiment to ours is the one by Gao & Johnson (2008) who run their Bayesian HMM over the whole WSJ and evaluated against the full gold standard, the only difference being is that we exclude the CoNLL shared task sec684  0  20  40  60  80  100  120  140  160  180  200  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 states DP-learnt DP-fixed PY-fixed  0  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 homogeneity DP-learnt DP-fixed PY-fixed  25  30  35  40  45  50  55  60  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 completeness DP-learnt DP-fixed PY-fixed  3.6  3.8  4  4.2  4.4  4.6  4.8  5  5.2  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 VI DP-learnt DP-fixed PY-fixed  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  55  60  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 V-measure DP-learnt DP-fixed PY-fixed  5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  55  60  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 V-beta DP-learnt DP-fixed PY-fixed Table 1: Performance of the three iHMM runs according to clustering evaluation measures against number of iteretions (in thousands).

D09-1071:5	12:228	Recent work (Johnson, 2007; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Gao and Johnson, 2008) explored the task of part-of-speech tagging (PoS) using unsupervised Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with encouraging results.
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1071:6	15:228	Johnson (2007) and Gao & Johnson (2008) assume that words are generated by a hidden Markov model and find that the resulting states strongly correlate with POS tags.
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1071:7	133:228	Recent work (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Johnson, 2007; Gao and Johnson, 2008) on this task explored a variety of methodologies to address this issue.

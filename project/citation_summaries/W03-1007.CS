Maximum Entropy (Maxent) models have been successfully applied to semantic role labelling (Fleischman et al. , 2003). 
Current automatic semantic parsing algorithms (Gildea and Jurafsky 2003, Fleischman et al. , 2003) are all based on syntactic parse trees showing a close coupling of semantic and syntactic structures. 
Fleischman et al.(FKH, 2003) extend G & Js work and achieve better performance in role classification for correct frame element boundaries. 
Regarding the learning component of the systems, we find pure probabilistic models (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003), Maximum Entropy (Fleischman et al. , 2003), generative models (Thompson et al. , 2003), Decision Trees (Surdeanu et al. , 2003; Chen and Rambow, 2003), and Support Vector Machines (Hacioglu and Ward, 2003; Pradhan et al. , 2003a; Pradhan et al. , 2003b). 
Inspired by previous work on syntax-driven semantic parsing (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Fleischman et al. , 2003), and syntax-based machine translation (Wu, 1997; Cuerzan and Yarowsky, 2002), we postulate that syntactically similar sentences with the same predicate also share similar semantic roles.

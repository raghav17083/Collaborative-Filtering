Johnson (2002) was the first post-processing approach to non-local dependency recovery, using a simple pattern-matching algorithm on context-free trees.

For traces, this corresponds to the evaluation using the head-based antecedent representation described in (Johnson, 2002), and for empty nodes without antecedents (e.g. , NP PRO) this is the measure used in Section 7.1. 
Johnson (2002) reports 85% precision and 74% recall (F 1 = 79%) for detection and 73% precision and 63% recall (F 1 = 68%) for detection plus resolution on the output of Charniaks parser. 
It suggests that one might improve performance by integrating parsing, empty node recovery and antecedent finding in a single system   (Johnson, 2002).

We wish to apply this direct, Bayesian approach to learn better translation rules for syntaxbased statistical MT (SSMT), by which we specifically refer to MT systems using Tree-to-String (TTS) translation templates derived from syntax trees (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006; Galley et al., 2006; May and Knight, 2007), as opposed to formally syntactic systems such as Hiero (Chiang, 2007). 
Based on these grammars, a great number of SMT models have been recently proposed, including string-to-string model (Synchronous FSG) (Brown et al., 1993; Koehn et al., 2003), tree-to-string model (TSG-string) (Huang et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007), string-totree model (string-CFG/TSG) (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006), tree-to-tree model (Synchronous CFG/TSG, Data-Oriented Translation) (Chiang, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Zhang et al., 2007; Bod, 2007; Quirk wt al., 2005; Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003) and so on. 
(2003), and apply the tree-to-string rule extraction algorithm (Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006), which resulted in 346K translation rules.

3 Improved Tree-to-string Transducer for Machine Translation 3.1 Normalization of TTS Templates Given the story that translations are generated based onthesourcesyntaxtrees,theweightofthetemplate is computed as the probability of the target strings given the source subtree: Weight(t) = #(t)#(tprime : LHS(tprime) = LHS(t)) Such normalization, denoted here as TREE, is used in most tree-to-string template-based MT systems (Liu et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006).

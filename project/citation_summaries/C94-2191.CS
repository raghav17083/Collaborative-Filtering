While various alternatives have been proposed, making use of e.g. neural networks, a situation semantics framework, or the principles of reasoning with uncertainty (e.g. Connoly et al. 1994; Mitkov 1995; Tin & Akman 1995), there is still a strong need for the development of robust and effective strategies to meet the demands of practical NLP systems, and to enhance further the automatic processing of growing language resources. 
Introduction For the most part, anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods (Carbonell & Brown 1988; Carter 1987; Hobbs 1978; Ingria & Stallard 1989; Lappin & McCord 1990; Lappin & Leass 1994; Mitkov 1994; Rich & LuperFoy 1988; Sidner 1979; Webber 1979). 
4 Topic is known by various terms in the literature, for instance focus (Sidner, 1986) or center (Mitkov, 1994b). 
Several proposals have already addressed the anaphora resolution problem by deliberately limiting the extent to which they rely on domain and/or linguistic knowledge (Baldwin 1997; Dagan & Itai 1990; Kennedy & Boguraev 1996; Mitkov 1998; Nasukawa 1994; Williams et al. 1996). 
3.1 Evaluation A Our first evaluation exercise (Mitkov & Stys 1997) was based on a random sample text from a technical manual in English (Minolta 1994).

Thus, over the past few years, along with advances in the use of learning and statistical methods for acquisition of full parsers (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997a; Charniak, 1997b; Ratnaparkhi, 1997), significant progress has been made on the use of statistical learning methods to recognize shallow parsing patterns  syntactic phrases or words that participate in a syntactic relationship (Church, 1988; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Argamon et al. , 1998; Cardie and Pierce, 1998; Munoz et al. , 1999; Punyakanok and Roth, 2001; Buchholz et al. , 1999; Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). 
Our results were not wildly worse than those reported by Buchholz et al (Sabine Buchholz and Daelemans, 1999). 
Since earlier versions of the SNoW based CSCL were used only to identify single phrases (Punyakanok and Roth, 2001; Munoz et al. , 1999) and never to identify a collection of several phrases at the same time, as we do here, we also trained and tested it under the exact conditions of CoNLL-2000 (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) to compare it to other shallow parsers. 
(1999) and Buchholz et al. 
The computation of grammatical relations from shallow parsers or chunkers is still at an early stage (Buchholz et al. , 1999, Carroll et al. , 1998) and there are few other robust semantic processors, and none in the medical domain.

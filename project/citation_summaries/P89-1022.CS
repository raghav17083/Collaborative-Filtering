Several techniques and results have been reported on learning subcategorization frames (SFs) from text corpora (Webster and Marcus, 1989; Brent, 1991; Brent, 1993; Brent, 1994; Ushioda et al. , 1993; Manning, 1993; Ersan and Charniak, 1996; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Carroll and Minnen, 1998; Carroll and Rooth, 1998). 
On the other hand, when learning of thematic role assignment has been the explicit goal, the text has been semantically annotated (Webster and Marcus 1989), or external semantic resources have been consulted (Aone and McKee 1996; McCarthy 2000). 
In (Hindle,1990; Zernik, 1989; Webster el Marcus, 1989) cooccurrence analyses augmented with syntactic parsing is used for the purpose of word classification. 
Finally, when learning of thematic role assignment has been the explicit goal, the text has been semantically annotated (Webster and Marcus, 1989), or external semantic re820 sources ha.re I)een consulted (Ache and McI(ee, 19!)6). 
Most existing computational natural language acquisition models also assumed various kinds of the extra input (e.g. semantic associations \[Siskind, 1990; Webster & Marcus, 1989; Zernik, 1987\] and syntactic structures \[Berwick, 1985; Liu & Soo, 1992a\] of input sentences) and human intervention (e.g. information interactively given by the trainer \[tang & Ilirschman, 1988; Velardi et al. , 1991\]) during learning.

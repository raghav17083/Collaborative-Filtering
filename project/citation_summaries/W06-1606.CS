2 Related Work In (Marcu et al., 2006), it is demonstrated that syntactified target language phrases can improve translation quality for ChineseEnglish. 
Based on these grammars, a great number of SMT models have been recently proposed, including string-to-string model (Synchronous FSG) (Brown et al., 1993; Koehn et al., 2003), tree-to-string model (TSG-string) (Huang et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007), string-totree model (string-CFG/TSG) (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006), tree-to-tree model (Synchronous CFG/TSG, Data-Oriented Translation) (Chiang, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Zhang et al., 2007; Bod, 2007; Quirk wt al., 2005; Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003) and so on. 
Statistical parsers are major components in NLP applications such as QA (Kwok et al., 2001), MT (Marcu et al., 2006) and SRL (Toutanova et al., 2005). 
Meanwhile, translation grammars have grown in complexity from simple inversion transduction grammars (Wu, 1997) to general tree-to-string transducers (Galley et al., 2004) and have increased in size by including more synchronous tree fragments (Galley et al., 2006; Marcuetal.,2006; DeNeefeetal.,2007). 
There is also substantial work in the use of target-side syntax (Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008).

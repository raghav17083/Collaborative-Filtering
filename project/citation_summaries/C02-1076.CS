Next the proposed RSCM sorts the mixture of all the MT outputs in the order of the average product of the scores of a language model and a translation model (Akiba et al. , 2002). 
Multiengine systems can be roughly divided into simple 1See (Hutchins et al. , 2006) for a list of commercial MT systems 2See http://www.euromatrix.net 193 Figure 1: Architecture for multi-engine MT driven by a SMT decoder architectures that try to select the best output from a number of systems, but leave the individual hypotheses as is (Tidhar and Kussner, 2000; Akiba et al. , 2001; Callison-Burch and Flournoy, 2001; Akiba et al. , 2002; Nomoto, 2004; Eisele, 2005) and more sophisticated setups that try to recombine the best parts from multiple hypotheses into a new utterance that can be better than the best of the given candidates, as described in (Rayner and Carter, 1997; Hogan and Frederking, 1998; Bangalore et al. , 2001; Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Matusov et al. , 2006; Rosti et al. , 2007). 
Next, it sorts the mixture of the MT outputs in all M-best lists in the order of the average product (Section 3.2) of the scores of a language model and a translation model (Akiba et al. , 2002). 
The elimination system is intended to be used in the selector architecture, as in (Akiba et al. , 2002). 
MT outputs in the mixture are sorted by using the average of the product scores by TMi and LMi for each i. In (Akiba et al. , 2002), this multiple scoring technique was shown to select the best translation better than a single scoring technique that uses TM and LM trained from a full corpus.

In the information projection approach (e.g. , (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001)), statistical word alignment is applied to a parallel corpus of English and some other language a0 for which no tagger/morphological analyzer/chunker etc. 
(Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001) aim at pos tagging a target language corpus using English pos tags as well as estimation of lexical priors (i.e. what pos tags can a word have with what probability) and a tag sequence model. 
It is an adaptation of the approach described by Yarowsky and Ngai (2001). 
Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) is of central relevance to this study. 
More recently, researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland have been exploring new ways to exploit parallel corpora in order to develop monolingual resources and tools, using a process of annotation, projection, and training: Given a parallel corpus in English and a less resource-rich language, we project English annotations across the parallel corpus to the second language, using word-level alignments as the bridge, and then use robust statistical techniques in learning from the resulting noisy annotations (Cabezas, Dorr, and Resnik 2001; Diab and Resnik 2002; Hwa et al. 2002; Lopez et al. 2002; Yarowsky, Ngai, and Wicentowski 2001; Yarowsky and Ngai 2001; Riloff, Schafer, and Yarowsky 2002).

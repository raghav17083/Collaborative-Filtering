Prasad and Strube (2000), for example, found that in Hindi the difference between grammatical-function and linear-order ranking is significant, and Strube and Hahn (1999) found significant differences between grammatical function and information structure in German. 
In previous corpus-based studies of centering (Walker 1989; Passonneau 1993; Byron and Stent 1998; Di Eugenio 1998; Kameyama 1998; Strube and Hahn 1999; Tetreault 2001), only a few instantiations of centering were compared. 
The principle of "cheapness" is intended to capture the intuition that a Retain is naturally followed by a Smooth Shift and is defined as follows: A transition pair is cheap if the backward-looking center of the current utterance is correctly predicted by the preferred center of the immediately preceding utterance, i.e., Cb(Ui) = Cp(Ui_l) (Strube and Hahn 1999, page 332) Cheapness is claimed to minimize the inferential costs of processing sequences of utterances, and is proposed as a constraint on pairs of successive transitions as a replacement for the canonical orderings in Rule 2, which is restated as follows: Rule 2 ~ Cheap transition pairs are preferred over expensive ones. 
However, this set is not needed to resolve pronominal anaphora (Strube and Hahn 1999). 
Work which addressed indirect anaphora in English texts so far restricts relationships to a small, relatively well-defined set, mainly part-of relation like the above example (2), and utilized hand-crafted heuristic rules or hand-crafted lexical knowledge such as WordNet (Hahn et al. , 1996; Vieira and Poesio, 2000; Strube and Hahn, 1999).

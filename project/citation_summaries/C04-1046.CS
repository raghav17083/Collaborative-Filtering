Possible applications for confidence measures include  post-editing, where words with low confidence could be marked as potential errors,  improving translation prediction accuracy in trans-type-style interactive machine translation (Gandrabur and Foster, 2003; Ueffing and Ney, 2005),  combining output from different machine translation systems: hypotheses with low confidence can be discarded before selecting one of the system translations (Akiba et al. , 2004), or the word confidence scores can be used for generating new hypotheses from the output of different systems (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005), or the sentence confidence value can be employed for re-ranking (Blatz et al. , 2003). 
Investigations on the use of the IBM-1 model for word confidence measures showed promising results (Blatz et al. , 2003; Blatz et al. , 2004). 
Deriving lexical relatedness between terms has been a topic of interest with applications in word sense disambiguation (Patwardhan et al., 2005), paraphrasing (Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006), question answering (Prager et al., 2001), and machine translation (Blatz et al., 2004) to name a few. 
Only recently have researchers started to investigate confidence measures for machine translation (Blatz et al. , 2004; Gandrabur and Foster, 2003; Quirk, 2004; Ueffing et al. , 2003). 
Furthermore, it would also require an effective way to do confidence estimation on translations, as traditional active learning approaches are effectively based on the identification (or generation) of instances where there is low confidence in the output (Blatz et al., 2004; Ueffing and Ney, 2004; Ueffing and Ney, 2005b; Ueffing and Ney, 2005a).

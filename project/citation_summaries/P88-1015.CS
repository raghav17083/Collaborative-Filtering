Finally, a method for segmenting dialogues based on a notion of control was used in Whittaker and Stenton (1988) and Walker and Whittaker (1990). 
2.3 Prior Theoretical Work on Mixed-Initiative Whittaker and Stenton (1988) propose a definition for dialogue control based on the utterance type of the speaker (question, assertion, command, or prompt) as follows:  Question: The speaker has control unless the question directly followed a question or command by the other conversant. 
3 3 Whittaker, Stenton, and Walker treat subdialogues initiated as a result of these cues as interruptions, motivated by their collaborative planning principles (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988; Walker and Whittaker, 1990). 
Whittaker and Stenton (1988) devised rules for allocating dialogue control based on utterance types, and Walker and Whittaker (1990) utilized these rules for an analytical study on discourse segmentation. 
Following Whittaker and Stenton (1988), we use utterance tags to determine whether an utterance shows initiative: forward functions show initiative while others do not.

U-DOP and UML-DOP are the results reported in Bod (2006b) and Bod (2006a) respectively. 
These include the constituentcontext model (CCM) (Klein and Manning, 2002), its extension using a dependency model (Klein and Manning, 2004), (U)DOP based models (Bod, 2006a; Bod, 2006b; Bod, 2007), an exemplar based approach (Dennis, 2005), guiding EM using contrastive estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2006), and the incremental parser of (Seginer, 2007). 
The last decade has seen significant progress in this field of research (Klein and Manning, 2002; Klein and Manning, 2004; Bod, 2006a; Bod, 2006b; Smith and Eisner, 2006; Seginer, 2007). 
Bod (2006) reports 82.9% unlabeled f-score on the same WSJ10 as used by Klein and Manning (2002, 2004). 
These include CCM (Klein and Manning, 2002), the DMV and DMV+CCM models (Klein and Manning, 2004), (U)DOP based models (Bod, 2006a; Bod, 2006b; Bod, 2007), an exemplar based approach (Dennis, 2005), guiding EM using contrastive estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2006), and the incremental parser of Seginer (2007) which we use here.

One of the motivations of the proposed sensebased representation is the fact that the interpretations of metonymic phrases tend to form coherent semantic classes (Pustejovsky, 1991; Pustejovsky, 1995; Godard and Jayez, 1993). 
Domain knowledge assigns doors, highways, and bridges a particular purpose, and so the fact that the sentences in (4b)(4d) are odd indicates that metonymic interpretations are subject to conventional constraints (Godard and Jayez 1993). 
It has been recognized (Pustejovsky, 1991; Pustejovsky, 1995; Godard and Jayez, 1993) and verified by us empirically that correct interpretations tend to form semantic classes, and therefore, correct interpretations should be related to each other by semantic relations, such as synonymy or hyponymy. 
Previous approaches have focused on descriptive (Vendler 1968) or theoretical (Pustejovsky 1991, 1995; Briscoe, Copestake, and Boguraev 1990) accounts, on the linguistic constraints on the phenomenon (Godard and Jayez 1993; Pustejovsky and Bouillon 1995; Copestake and Briscoe 1995; Copestake 2001), and on the influence of discourse context on the interpretation of metonymies (Briscoe, Copestake, and Boguraev 1990; Lascarides and Copestake 1998; Verspoor 1997). 
(Godard and Jayez, 1993) The metonymic adage in (1) is a classical example.

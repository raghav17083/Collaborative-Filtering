This kind of features have been widely used in both newswire NER system, such as (Zhou and Su 2002), and biomedical NER system, such as (Nobata et al. 1999; Gaizauskas et al. 2000; Collier et al. 2000; Takeuchi and Collier 2002; Kazama et al. 2002). 
Recently, machine learning approaches are widely used in NER, including the hidden Markov model (Zhou and Su, 2000; Miller and Crystal, 1998), maximum entropy model (Borthwick, 1999), decision tree (Qin and Yuan, 2004), transformation-based learning (Black and Vasilakopoulos, 2002), boosting (Collins, 2002; Carreras et al. , 2002), support vector machine (Takeuchi and Collier, 2002; Yu et al. , 2004; Goh et al. , 2003), memory-based learning (Sang, 2002). 
Since in previous work, many NER systems have been applied successfully in newswire domain (Zhou and Su 2002; Bikel et al. 1999; Borthwich et al. 1999), more and more explorations have been done to port existing NER system into biomedical domain (Kazama et al. 2002; Takeuchi et al. 2002; Nobata et al. 1999 and 2000; Collier et al. 2000; Gaizauskas et al. 2000; Fukuda et al. 1998; Proux et al. 1998). 
The latter is currently dominating in NER amongst which the most popular methods are decision tree (Sekine et al. , 1998; Pailouras et al. , 2000), Hidden Markov Model (Zhang et al. , 2003; Zhao, 2004), maximum entropy (Chieu and Ng, 2002; Bender et al. , 2003), and support vector machines (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002; Takeuchi and Collier, 2002; Mayfield, 2003). 
The other SVM-based NER systems can be found in (Takeuchi and Collier, 2002) and (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2003).

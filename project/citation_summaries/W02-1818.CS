W06-0112:1	24:131	There are some other methods to deal with Chinese phrase (no only base NP) chunking, such as HMM (Heng Li et al. , 2003), Maximum Entropy (Zhou Yaqian et al. , 2003), Memory-Based Learning (Zhang and Zhou, 2002) etc. 87 However, according to our experiments over 30,000 Chinese words, the best results of Chinese base NP chunking are about 5% less than that of English chunking (Although we should admit the chunking outcomes vary among different sizes of corpus and rely on the details of experiments).

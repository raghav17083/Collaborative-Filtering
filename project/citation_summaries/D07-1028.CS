There are other approaches in which the generation grammars are extracted semiautomatically (Belz, 2007) or automatically (such as HPSG (Nakanishi and Miyao, 2005), LFG (Cahill and van Genabith, 2006; Hogan et al., 2007) and CCG (White et al., 2007)). 
For example, multi-word NPs like Texas Instruments Japan Ltd. are realized as Japan Texas Instruments Ltd Inspired by Hogan et al.s (2007)s Experiment 1, we decided to use the BBN corpus NE annotation (Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005) to collapse certain classes of NEs. 
The generator used in our experiments is an instance of the second type, using a probability model defined over Lexical Functional Grammar c-structure and f-structure annotations (Cahill and van Genabith, 2006; Hogan et al., 2007). 
For example, multiword NPs like Texas Instruments Japan Ltd. were realized as Japan Texas Instruments Ltd. Accordingly, inspired by Hogan et al.s (2007)s Experiment 1, Rajkumar et al. used the BBN corpus NE annotation to collapse certain classes of NEs. 
We have taken the Table-3 from (Guo et al., 2008), which shows the BLEU scores of different Paper BLEU score Langkilde(2002) 0.757 Nakanishi(2005) 0.705 Cahill(2006) 0.6651 Hogan(2007) 0.6882 White(2007) 0.5768 Guo(2008) 0.7440 Our Model 0.8156 Table 3: Comparsion of results for English WSJ section 23 systems on section 23 of PTB.

4 The impact to the evaluation caused by segmentation errors in corpora of Bakeoff1 In order to show the impact to the evaluation result caused by EIs existing in test data of Bakeoff1, we conduct the baseline close test with PK and AS corpora, i.e. we compile lexicons only containing words in their training data and then use the lexicons with a forward maximum matching algorithm to segment their test data respectively (Sproat and Emerson, 2003). 
The following values are used to evaluate the performance of word segmentation: R : Recall (The number of correctly segmented words in systems output divided by the number of words in test data) P : Precision (The number of correctly segmented words in systems output divided by the number of words in systems output) F : F-measure (F = 2RP=(R+P)) Rknown : Recall for known words Runknown : Recall for unknown words Corpus # of Training Words # of Testing Words # of Words Rate of (known/unknown) in Dictionary Unknown Words AS 5,806,611 11,985 (11,727/ 258) 146,212 0.0215 HK 239,852 34,955 (32,463/2,492) 23,747 0.0713 PK 1,121,017 17,194 (16,005/1,189) 55,226 0.0692 RWCP 840,879 93,155 (93,085/ 70) 315,602 0.0008 Table 3: Statistical Information of Corpora 4.1 Experiments of Chinese Word Segmentation We use three Chinese word-segmented corpora, the Academia Sinica corpus (AS), the Hong Kong City University corpus (HK) and the Beijing University corpus (PK), all of which were used in the First International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff (Sproat and Emerson, 2003) at ACL-SIGHAN 2003. 
2.2.notdef.g0001 Rules and Procedures The bakeoff was run almost identically to the first described in Sproat and Emerson (2003): the detailed instructions provided to the participants are available on the bakeoff website at http://www.sighan.org/bakeoff2005/. 
For example, there is no single segmenter in the Bakeoff that achieved top-2 ranks in all four test sets (Sproat and Emerson 2003). 
SIGHAN, the Special Interest Group for Chinese Language Processing of the Association for Computational Linguistics, conducted two prior word segmentation bakeoffs, in 2003 and 2005(Emerson, 2005), which established benchmarks for word segmentation against which other systems are judged.

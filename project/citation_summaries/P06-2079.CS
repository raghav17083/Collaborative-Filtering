There has been some work on detecting reviews in large-scale collections (Ng et al., 2006; Barbosa et al., 2009); this is a logical step that precedes the review matching step, the topic of our paper. 
There are many research directions, e.g., sentiment classification (classifying an opinion document as positive or negative) (e.g., Pang, Lee and Vaithyanathan, 2002; Turney, 2002), subjectivity classification (determining whether a sentence is subjective or objective, and its associated opinion) (Wiebe and Wilson, 2002; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Wilson et al, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Riloff and Wiebe, 2005), feature/topic-based sentiment analysis (assigning positive or negative sentiments to topics or product features) (Hu and Liu 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Carenini et al., 2005; Ku et al., 2006; Kobayashi, Inui and Matsumoto, 2007; Titov and McDonald. 
3 Background 3.1 Basic Matrix Factorization Model Our proposed models are based on non-negative matrix Tri-factorization (Ding et al., 2006). 
Some lexicons assign real number scores to indicate sentiment orientations and strengths (i.e. probabilities of having positive and negative sentiments) (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) while other lexicons assign discrete classes (weak/strong, positive/negative) (Wilson et al., 2005). 
One of the main directions is sentiment classification, which classifies the whole opinion document (e.g., a product review) as positive or negative (e.g., Pang et al, 2002; Turney, 2002; Dave et al, 2003; Ng et al. 2006; McDonald et al, 2007).

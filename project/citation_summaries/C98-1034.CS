Early attempts at NP Chunking were rule learning systems, such as the Error Driven Pruning method of Pierce and Cardie (1998). 
Thus, over the past few years, along with advances in the use of learning and statistical methods for acquisition of full parsers (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997a; Charniak, 1997b; Ratnaparkhi, 1997), significant progress has been made on the use of statistical learning methods to recognize shallow parsing patterns  syntactic phrases or words that participate in a syntactic relationship (Church, 1988; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Argamon et al. , 1998; Cardie and Pierce, 1998; Munoz et al. , 1999; Punyakanok and Roth, 2001; Buchholz et al. , 1999; Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). 
A simple approach is presented in (Cardie and Pierce, 1998) called Treebank Apl)roach (TA). 
Introduction Recently, there has been an increased interest in approaches to automatically learning to recognize shallow linguistic patterns in text \[Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995, Vilain and Day, 1996, Argamon et al. , 1998, Buchholz, 1998, Cardie and Pierce, 1998, Veenstra, 1998, Daelemans et aI. 
(Cardie and Pierce, 1998) store POS tag sequences that make up complete chunks and use these sequences as rules for classifying unseen data.

The rst we borrow (slightly modi ed) from work in automatic word sense disambiguation (Gale et al. , 1992), calling it one referent per discourse . It assumes that a place name mentioned in a discourse refers to the same location throughout the discourse, just as a word is assumed to be used in the same one sense throughout the discourse. 
WSD that make use of the information provided by machine readable dictionaries (Cowie et al. , 1992), (Miller et al. , 1994), (Agirre and Rigau, 1995), (Li et al. , 1995), (McRoy, 1992); 2. 
In this section, we propose a new greedy algorithm which can be seen as an extension of (Hirst and StOnge, 1997) and (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997) algorithms as it allows polysemous words to belong to different chains thus breaking the one-word/oneconcept per document paradigm (Gale et al. , 1992). 
Apply the one sense per discourse principle [Gale et al.1992] for each disambiguated location name to propagate the selected sense to its other mentions within a document; Step 4. 
There are also hybrid methods that combine several sources of knowledge such as lexicon information, heuristics, collocations and others (McRoy, 1992) (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994) (Ng and Lee, 1996) (Rigau, Asterias et al. , 1997).

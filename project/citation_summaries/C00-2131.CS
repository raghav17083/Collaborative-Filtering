Some of these employ parsers to produce dependency structures for the sentence pairs in aligned bilingual corpora, which are then aligned to obtain transfer rules or examples (Meyers et al. 2000; Watanabe et al. 2000). 
For example, such schema can serve as a mean to represent translation examples, or find structural correspondences for the purpose of transfer grammar learning (Menezes & Richardson, 2001), (Aramaki et al. , 2001), (Watanabe et al. , 2000), (Meyers et al. , 2000), (Matsumoto et al. , 1993), (kaji et al. , 1992), and example-base machine translation EBMT 3 (Sato & Nagao, 1990), (Sato, 1991), (Richardson et al. , 2001), (Al-Adhaileh & Tang, 1999). 
1 Related Works Most of the previous works conduct structure alignment with complex, hierarchical structures, such as phrase structures (e.g. , Kaji, Kida & Morimoto, 1992), or dependency structures (e.g. , Matsumoto et al. 1993; Grishman, 1994; Meyers, Yanharber & Grishman 1996; Watanabe, Kurohashi & Aramaki 2000). 
For some EBMT systems, substantial collections of examples are also manually crafted or at least reviewed for correctness after being identified automatically (Watanabe et al. 2000; Brown 1999; Franz et al. 2000). 
Then the correspondent structures in different languages are aligned (e.g. , Kaji, Kida & Morimoto 1992; Matsumoto et al. 1993; Grishman 1994; Meyers, Yanharber & Grishman 1996; Watanabe, Kurohashi & Aramaki 2000).

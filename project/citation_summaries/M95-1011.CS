Many research groups are implementing the efficient customization of information extraction systems, such as BBN (Weischedel 1995), NYU (Grishman 1995), SRI (Appelt, Hobbs, et al 1995), SRA (Krupka 1995), MITRE (Aberdeen, Burger, et al 1995), and UMass (Fisher, Soderland, et al 1995). 
Solne of this work has enli)hasized il\]teractive tools to (:onvert examples to extractioi~ t)atterlls (Yangarber and Grishman, 1997); nmch ot:' the re, search has focused on methods for automatically converting a cortms annotated with extraction examples into patterns (Lehnert et al. , 1992; Fisher et al. , 1995; Miller el; al. , 1998). 
The RESOLVE system is presented in McCarthy and Lehnert (1995), Fisher et al. 
Gathering knowledge from unstructured text often requires manually crafting knowledgeengineering rules both complex and deeply dependent of the domain at hand, although some successful experiences using learning algorithms have been reported (Fisher et al. , 1995; Chieu et al. , 2003). 
Many research groups are making progress toward efficient customization, such as BBN (Weischedel, 1995), NYU (Grishman, 1995), SRI (Appelt et al. , 1995), SRA (Krupka, 1995), MITRE (Aberdeen et al. , 1995), UMass (Fisher et al. , 1995)etc. SRI developed a specification language called FASTSPEC that automatically translates regular productions written by the developer into finite state machines (Appelt et al. , 1995).

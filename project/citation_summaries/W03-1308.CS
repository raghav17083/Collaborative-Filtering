Several works employing SVM classifier have been done (Kazama et al. , 2002; Lee et al. , 2003; Takeuchi and Collier, 2003; Yamamoto et al. , 2003), and will be discussed further in the rest of this paper.


For the biomedical domain, the work of Takeuchi and Collier (2003) demonstrates the successful incorporation of shallow parsing.

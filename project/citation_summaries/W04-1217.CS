Each word is tagged with B-X, I-X, or O to indicate that the word is at the beginning (B) or inside (I) of a named entity of type X, or 1http://research.nii.ac.jp/collier/ workshops/JNLPBA04st.htm System F1 (Zhou and Su, 2004) 72.55 Online Cascaded 72.16 (Okanohara et al., 2006) 71.48 (Kim et al., 2005) 71.19 (Finkel et al., 2004) 70.06 (Settles, 2004) 69.80 Table 1: Comparisons with other systems on overall performance (in percentage). 
It is somewhat surprising that Maximum Entropy Models were applied by only one system (Finkel et al. , 2004), while it was the most successfully applied model in the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task of Named Entity Recognition, and at this time also the MEMM system yields quite good performance. 
We employ the Stanford CRF-based Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al., 2004) for named entity tagging. 
Many of the previous studies of Bio-NER tasks have been based on machine learning techniques including Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Bikel et al. , 1997), the dictionary HMM model (Kou et al. , 2005) and Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs) (Finkel et al. , 2004). 
Various statistical approaches, e.g., a maximum entropy model (Finkel et al. , 2004), HMMs and SVMs (GuoDong et al. , 2005), have been used with various feature sets including surface and syntactic features, word formation patterns, morphological patterns, part-of-speech tags, head noun triggers, and coreferences.

Our notion of preference Our approach, although stemming from earlier work in the Eurotra project (McNaught et al 1983, Johnson et al 1985), is, we believe, new and original. 
The ideas described in this section were first presented at the the Colgate Conference on Methodological Issues in MT (Arnold et al, Des Tombe et al, 1985).

Following Weischedel and Sondheimer (1983) we distinguish the cases 134 where preference is part of the particular computation being performed (Wilks 1973, Fass and Wilks 1983, Pereira 1985) from the case where it is a separate process, run after the results of the computation have been obtained (Jensen et al 1983, Weischedel and Sondheimer 1983). 
We will not discuss the nature of the representation languages here in any detail (see Arnold et al, #anuary 1985, for detailed discussion), hut it seems important that they should he: 297 (i) DifLe\[eE~atin~L: This is required if the system is to preserve whatever properties are preserved under" 'correct translation'.

It has been used, among others, for the description of Arabic morphology (Beesley, 1998). 
(1989) with a detouring mechanism for access to multiple lexica, which gives rise to other works by Beesley (Beesley, 1998) and, independently, by Buckwalter (2004). 
In a number of works, Beesley (1996; 1998; 2001) describes a finite-state morphological analyzer of Modern Standard Arabic which handles both inflectional and derivational morphology, including interdigitation. 
(1989) with a detouring mechanism for access to multiple lexica, which later gave rise to other works by Beesley (Beesley, 1998) and, independently, by Buckwalter (2004). 
Previous work to implement Semitic languages, namely, Akkadian (Kataja and Koskenniemi 1988), Arabic (Beesley, Buckwalter, and Newton 1989; Beesley 1990, 1991, 1996, 1998a, 1998b, 1998c, forthcoming) and Hebrew (Lavie, Itai, and Ornan 1990), employed traditional two-level morphology with some augmentation to handle the nonlinearity of stems, but did not make any use of the then-available theory of nonconcatenative morphology.

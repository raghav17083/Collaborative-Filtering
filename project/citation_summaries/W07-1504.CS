The data-driven schedules were generated through 10-fold cross-validation as part of a previous study (Foster and Oberlander, 2007): that is, the display counts from 90% of the corpus were used to select the displays to use for the sentences in the held-out 10%. 
The responses given by the subjects in this study also showed a signifi98 123 93 Original vs. Rule-based Weighted vs. Rule-based Original vs. Weighted 0255075100125 120 97 123 92 (a) Original, weighted, rule-based 295 153 Original vs. Majority Weighted vs. Majority Original vs. Weighted 050100150200250300 278 170 251 197 (b) Original, weighted, majority (Foster and Oberlander, 2007) Figure 3: Pairwise preferences from the user evaluations cant preference for the original schedules over the weighted ones (c2(1;N = 448) = 6:51, p < 0:05). 
Full details of this corpus are given in Foster (2007a). 
Figure 3(b) shows the results from a similar previous study (Foster and Oberlander, 2007) in which the subjects compared the two data-driven strategies to the original displays, using a design identical to that used in the current study with 54 subjects and 24 sentences. 
100 As expectedand as noted by Foster and Oberlander (2007)all of the corpus-reproduction metrics strongly favoured the weighted strategy over the weighted strategy and generally penalised the rulebased strategy.

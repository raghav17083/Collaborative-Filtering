MDL has information theoretic underpinnings, and an information theoretic objective function achieves similar success (Snover et al. , 2002). 
Combined with heuristics such as string edit distance, it can be used to find reliable conflation sets (Xu and Croft, 1998; Baroni et al. , 2002). 
Some morphology discovery algorithms learn relationships between words by comparing the orthographic or semantic similarity of the words (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000; Neuvel and Fulop, 2002; Baroni et al. , 2002).

(1995) give an information theoretic method for discovering meaningful affixes, which was later extended to enable a novel search algorithm based on a probabilistic word-generation model (Snover et al. , 2002).

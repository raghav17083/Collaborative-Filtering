The program consults a lexical database which contains approximately 150,000 semantic associations between word senses, the result of autonmtically parsing the definition text of each noun and verb sense in LDOCE and then applying a set of heuristic rules which antomatically attempt to identify any systematic semantic relationships holding between a headword and the (base forms of) words used to define it (Jensen & Binot, 1987; Montemagni and Vanderwende, 1992). 
Sense disambiguation is also necessary for certain syntactic analyses, such as prepositional phrase attachment (Jensen and Binot 1987; Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner 1990; Hindle and Rooth 1993), and, in general, restricts the space of competing parses (Alshawi and Carter 1994). 
(Markowitz e~ al. 1986), (Jensen & Binot 1987), and (Nakamura & Nagao 1988) also use pattern recognition to extract semantic relations such as taxonomy from various dictionaries. 
Like common nouns, ((Jensen and Binot 1987), (Hindle and Rooth 1993) and (Brill and Resnick 1994)), proper names exhibit structural ambiguity in prepositional phrase (PP) attachment and in conjunction scope. 
Historically, the shift from attempts to resolve the problem completely, by using heuristics developed using typical AI techniques (Jensen and Binot, 1987; Marcus, 1980; Crain and Steedman, 1985; Altmann and Steedman, 1988) has left the place for attempts to solve the problem by less expensive means, even if only approximately.

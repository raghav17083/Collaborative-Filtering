Other algorithms combine information of both orthographic and semantic similarity of words (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000; Baroni et al. , 2002). 
These relations are mainly prefixal or suffixal with two exceptions, (Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000) and (Baroni et al., 2002), who use string edit distances to estimate formal similarity. 
Lastly, and most importantly, all of the reviewed techniques (Wicentowski, 2004; Wicentowski, 2002; Snover et al. , 2002; Baroni et al. , 2002; Andreev, 1965; Cavar et al. , 2004; Snover and Brent, 2003; Snover and Brent, 2001; Snover, 2002; Schone and Jurafsky, 2001; Jacquemin, 1997; Goldsmith and Hu, 2004; Sharmaetal. 
Some morphology discovery algorithms learn relationships between words by comparing the orthographic or semantic similarity of the words (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000; Neuvel and Fulop, 2002; Baroni et al. , 2002). 
Two methods that might help here would be (a) to use some form of string-edit distance (Kruskal 1983), weighted by phonetic similarity, to determine that -schleppis the string shared by the two forms; (b) to adopt some method of morpheme discovery (e.g. Baroni 2000; Goldsmith 2001; Neuvel, to appear; Schone and Jurafsky 2001; Baroni et al. 2002) and use its results to favor rules that prefix geand suffix -t.

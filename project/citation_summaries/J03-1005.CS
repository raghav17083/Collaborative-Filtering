5 Experimental Results The phrase-based decoder we use is inspired by the decoder described in (Tillmann and Ney, 2003) and similar to that described in (Koehn, 2004). 
Our implementation of a monotone-at-punctuation reordering constraint (Tillmann and Ney, 2003) requires that all input words before clauseseparating punctuation have be translated, before words afterwards are covered. 
is carried out in one pass over some input along a specific direction: in speech recognition the search is timesynchronous, the single-word based search algorithm in (Tillmann et al. , 1997) is (source) position-synchronous or left-to-right, the search algorithm in (Niessen et al. , 1998) is (target) position-synchronous or bottom-to-top, and the search algorithm in (Tillmann and Ney, 2003) is so-called cardinality-synchronous. 
DTM2 Decoder: The decoder for the baseline is a beam search decoder similar to decoders used in standard phrase-based log-linear systems such as (Tillmann and Ney, 2003) and (Koehn, 2004a). 
The same beam-search pruning as described in (Tillmann and Ney, 2003) is used.

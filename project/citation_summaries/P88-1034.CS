Joshi, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir (Joshi, VijayShanker, and Weir, 1989; Weir and Joshi, 1988) have shown that LIGs, Combinatory Categorial Grammars (CCG), Tree Adjoinig Grammars (TAGs), and Head Grammars (HGs) are weakly equivalent. 
128-131) (together with suggested extensions to Linear Indexed Grammars) and Weir and Joshi (1988, p. 284). 
Based on the formal definition of CCGs in (Weir-Joshi 1988), a CCG, G, is denoted by (VT, VN, S, f, R), where  lit is a finite set of terminals,  VN is a finite set of nonterminals,  S is a distinguished member of VN,  f is a function that maps elements of VT U {e} to finite subsets of C(VN), the set of categories, where, VN C C(VN) and if el and c2  C(VN), then (el\c2) and (cl/c2)  *I would like to thank Mark Steedman, Libby Levison, Owen Rambow, and the anonymous referees for their valuable advice. 
The weak equivalence of TAGs, a modified version of Head Grammars and Linear Indexed Grammars has been shown in Vijayashanker (1988), while the weak equivalence of these three formalisms and Combinatory Categorial Grammars has been shown in Weir (1988) and Weir and Joshi (1988). 
The details of the examination of the relationship between CCG and LIG may be found in Weir and Joshi (1988) and Weir (1988).

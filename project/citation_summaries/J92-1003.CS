Ritchie (1992) summarizes aspects of this analysis as presented by Kaplan (1988). 
It is interesting to note that for much the same reason, Ritchie (1992) also made crucial use of two-level boundary-context rules to prove that the relations denoted by Koskenniemi's (1985) two-level grammars are also coextensive with the regular relations. 
3 Although further development and application of this model is set to continue for some time, there is now a clear need to integrate it more closely with computational * University of Edinburgh, Centre for Cognitive Science, 2 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh EH8 9LW, Scotland, U.K. E-mail: {steven,marke}@cogsci.ed.ac.uk 1 (Antworth 1990; Ritchie, Russell, Black, and Pulman 1992; Sproat 1992) 2 (Bear 1986; Antworth 1990; Schiller and Steffens 1991; Pulman and Hepple 1993) 3 Two caveats are necessary here. 
As we mentioned before, the two-level grammars with boundary-context rules are the ones that Ritchie (1992) showed were complete for the regular relations. 
Via the work of Johnson (1972), Koskenniemi (1984), and Kaplan and Kay--the latter in circulation since the early eighties but appearing in published form for the first time in the present collection--one could reasonably argue that SPE gave rise to finite-state morphology (Antworth 1990; Ritchie et al. 1992; Sproat 1992).

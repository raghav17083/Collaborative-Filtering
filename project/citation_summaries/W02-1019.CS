P09-1064:1	35:221	Minimizing risk has been shown to improve performance for MT (Kumar and Byrne, 2004), as well as other language processing tasks (Goodman, 1996; Goel and Byrne, 2000; Kumar and Byrne, 2002; Titov and Henderson, 2006; Smith and Smith, 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
P03-1021:2	141:159	In the field of natural language processing this approach has been applied for example in parsing (Goodman, 1996) and word alignment (Kumar and Byrne, 2002).
---------------------------------------------------
E09-1088:3	196:222	For more details of the MBR technique, refer to Goel & Byrne (2000) and Kumar & Byrne (2002).
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1065:4	13:259	The approach has been shown to give improvements over the MAP classifier in many areas of natural language processing including automatic speech recognition (Goel and Byrne, 2000), machine translation (Kumar and Byrne, 2004; Zhang and Gildea, 2008), bilingual word alignment (Kumar and Byrne, 2002), andparsing(Goodman, 1996; TitovandHenderson, 2006; Smith and Smith, 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
N04-1022:5	144:155	Translation lattices (Ueffing et al. , 2002; Kumar and Byrne, 2003) are a compact representation of a large set of most likely translations generated by an MT system.
---------------------------------------------------
N04-1022:6	14:155	We apply the Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) techniques developed for automatic speech recognition (Goel and Byrne, 2000) and bitext word alignment for statistical MT (Kumar and Byrne, 2002), to the problem of building automatic MT systems tuned for specific metrics.

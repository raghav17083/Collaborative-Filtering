3Compare Bateman (1999), where a KB is compiled into a format that brings out the commonalities between objects before the content of a referring expression is determined. 
Recently, algorithms have also been developed to the identification of sets of objects rather than individuals (Bateman 1999, Stone 2000, Krahmer, v. Erk, and Verweg 2001), and the repertoire of descriptions has been extended to boolean combinations of attributes, including negations (van Deemter 2002). 
Introduction The generation of referring expressions is one of the most common tasks in natural language generation and has been addressed by many researchers in the past two decades, including Appelt (1985), Reiter (1990), Dale and Haddock (1991), Dale (1992), Dale and Reiter (1995), Horacek (1997), Stone and Webber (1998), Krahmer and Theune (1998, 2002), Bateman (1999), and van Deemter (2000, 2002). 
Recently, algorithms have been applied to the identification of sets of objects rather than individuals [Bateman 1999, Stone 2000, Krahmer, v. Erk, and Verweg 2001], and the repertoire of descriptions has been extended to boolean combinations of attributes, including negations [van Deemter 2002]. 
Conversely, a complex algorithm can be safe to use if the domain is small (or if key calculations can be performed offline; e.g., Bateman 1999).

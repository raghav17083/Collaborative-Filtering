Some morphology discovery algorithms learn relationships between words by comparing the orthographic or semantic similarity of the words (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000; Neuvel and Fulop, 2002; Baroni et al. , 2002). 
Using latent semantic analysis, Schone and Jurafsky (2000) have previously demonstrated the success of using semantic information in morphological analysis. 
4 Evaluation We compare this improved algorithm to our former algorithm (Schone and Jurafsky (2000)) as well as to Goldsmith's Linguistica (2000). 
Next along the spectrum of orthographic similarity bias is the work of Schone and Jurafsky (2000; 2001), who first acquire a list of potential morphological variants using an orthographic similarity technique due to Gaussier (1999) in which pairs of words with the same initial string are identified. 
1 Introduction Unsupervised morphology acquisition attempts to learn from raw corpora one or more of the following about the written morphology of a language: (1) the segmentation of the set of word types in a corpus (Creutz and Lagus, 2007), (2) the clustering of word types in a corpus based on some notion of morphological relatedness (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000), (3) the generation of out-of-vocabulary items which are morphologically related to other word types in the corpus (Yarowsky et al., 2001).

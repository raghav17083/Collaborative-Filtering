For LTAGs, in particular, there has been quite a few proposals, as we have already mentioned (Vijay-Shanker and Schabes, 1992; Becker, 1993; Candito, 1996; Evans et al. , 1995; Xia, 2001), and even large-scale grammars built with them, e.g., the French grammar in (Abeille and Candito, 2000) and an English one in (Xia, 2001). 
These features also markedly distinguish XMG from existing formalisms used to encode tree based grammars such as the nonmonotonic encoding of TAG proposed in (Evans et al., 1995) (in contrast, XMG is fully monotonic) and the tree descriptions based approaches proposed in (Candito, 1996; Xia et al., 1998) where in particular, tree descriptions can only be conjoined (not disjoined) and where identification across tree fragments is restricted to nodes. 
The notion of Metagrammar Metagrammars were first introduced by Candito (1996) to manually encode syntactic knowledge in a compact and abstract class hierarchy which supports multiple inheritance, and from which a TAG is automatically generated offline. 
Several approaches have been proposed in the literature describing compact representations methods for LTAGs, perhaps the best known being (VijayShanker and Schabes, 1992), (Candito, 1996; Candito, 1998), (Evans et al. , 1995; Evans et al. , 2000), (Xia et al. , 1998; Xia, 2001), and (Becker, 1993; Becker, 1994; Becker, 2000). 
However, the problem of grammar size in TAG has to some extent been addressed both with respect to grammar encoding (Evans et al. , 1995; Candito, 1996) and parsing (Joshi and Srinivas, 1994; Evans and Weir, 1998).

Temporal analysis has also been applied in Question-Answering systems (Pustejovsky et al. , 2004; Schilder and Habel, 2003; Prager et al. , 2003), email classification (Kiritchenko et al. , 2004), aiding the precision of Information Retrieval results (Berlanga et al. , 2001), document summarisation (Mani and Wilson, 2000), time stamping of event clauses (Filatova and Hovy, 2001), temporal ordering of events (Mani et al. , 2003) and temporal reasoning from text (Boguraev and Ando, 2005; Moldovan et al. , 2005). 
Although there has been much work on extracting and inferring such information from texts (Hitzeman et al. , 1995; Mani and Wilson, 2000; Filatova and Hovy, 2001; Boguraev and Ando, 2005), none of this work has exploited the implicit event duration information from the text. 
3 Related Work The literature contains a number of approaches to the interpretation of weekday names, although we are not aware of any pre-existing direct comparison of these approaches.3 Filatova and Hovy (2001) assign time stamps to clauses in which an event is mentioned.

Although there has been much work on temporal anchoring and event ordering in text (Hitzeman et al. , 1995; Mani and Wilson, 2000; Filatova and Hovy, 2001; Boguraev and Ando, 2005), to our knowledge, there has been no serious published empirical effort to model and learn vague and implicit duration information in natural language, such as the typical durations of events, and to perform reasoning over this information.

We used the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003), and also a variant of the Stanford parser (i.e., Stanford-Genia), which was trained on the GENIA treebank (Tateisi et al., 2005) for biomedical text;  Deep parsers aim to compute in-depth syntactic and semantic structures based on syntactic theories such as HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) and CCG (Steedman, 2000). 
The parser was trained using 8,000 sentences from the GENIA Treebank (Tateisi et al., 2005), which contains abstracts of papers taken from MEDLINE, annotated with syntactic structures. 
Due in large part to the creation of biomedical treebanks (Kulick et al., 2004; Tateisi et al., 2005) and rapid progress of data-driven parsers (Lease and Charniak, 2005; Nivre et al., 2007), there are now fast, robust and accurate syntactic parsers for text in the biomedical domain. 
The POS analyzer and HPSG parser are trained by using the GENIA corpus (Tsuruoka et al. , 2005; Hara et al. , 2005), which comprises around 2,000 MEDLINE abstracts annotated with POS and Penn Treebank style syntactic parse trees (Tateisi et al. , 2005). 
Because our target is biomedical texts, we re-trained a parser (Hara et al. , 2005) with the GENIA treebank (Tateisi et al. , 2005), and also applied a bidirectional part-ofspeech tagger (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005) trained with the GENIA treebank as a preprocessor.

As the number of PPs in a sentence increases, the number of possible parse trees and their corresponding representations grows as the Catalan numbers, C,, = \[2n~ 1 (Church \ n,' n+l and Patil 1982). 
6 Related Work and Conclusions Our work can be seen as an algorithmic realization of suggestions of Church and Patil (1980; 1982) on algebraic simplifications of CFGs of regular languages. 
For instance, depth cutoffs in the method described by Black (1989) lead to approximating FSAs whose language is neither a subset nor a superset of the language of the given phrase-structure grammar, In contrast, our method will produce an exact FSA for many interesting grammars generating regular languages, such as those arising from systematic attachment ambiguities (Church and Patil, 1982). 
This is also a good place to recall the difference between recognition and parsing: if parsing requires that distinct structures be produced for all parses, it will be TIME(2n), since in some grammars sentences of length n may have 2 n parses (Church and Patil 1982).

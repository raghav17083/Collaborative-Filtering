There is another trend in the research in this field, namely, the automatic acquisition of paraphrase patterns from parallel or comparable corpora (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pang et al. , 2003; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003, etc.). 
Barzilay and McKeown (2001) identify multi-word paraphrases from a sentence-aligned corpus of monolingual parallel texts. 
Barzilay and McKeown (2001) extracted paraphrases using multiple translations of literature works. 
Most of the reported work on paraphrase generation from arbitrary input sentences uses machine learning techniques trained on sentences that are known or can be inferred to be paraphrases of each other (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Callison-Burch et al. , 2006; Dolan et al. , 2004; Ibrahim et al. , 2003; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pang et al. , 2003; Quirk et al. , 2004; Shinyama et al. , 2002). 
Barzilay and McKeown (2001) used a monolingual parallel corpus to obtain paraphrases.

Pullum (1984b) likewise heaped scorn on my argument that English reshmuplicative constructions show non-CFness, but he accepted (1984a; 1984b) Culy's (1985) argument about noun reduplication in Bambara and Shieber's (1985) one about Swiss German cross-serial constructions of causative and perception verbs and their objects. 
Computational Linguistics, Volume 10, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1984 185 Geoffrey K. Pullum On Two Recent Attempts to Show that English Is Not a CFL languages cannot be described by a CF grammar in a manner that allows a suitable syntax-to-semantics mapping to be defined (see Bresnan, Kaplan, Peters, and Zaenen (1982) on Dutch)/' ~'Shieber (in press), which I saw in a preliminary version after completing this paper but have not seen in its final form at the time of going to press, extends the result about Dutch to make a much stronger claim about a related language, Swiss German, namely that it has a syntactic analog of the Dutch pattern and overall is not even CF. 
Such semantic filtering is not without history (Cf Pullum 1984) but it seems especially fruitful with the Synchronous TAG formalism because: the syntax and the semantics use extactly the same formalism, the syntactic and semantic derivations are necessarily built up in parallel. 
Two new arguments, Higginbotham's (1984) one involving such that relativization and Postal and Langendoen's (1984) one about sluicing were dismissed on grounds of descriptive inadequacy by Pullum (1984a), who, however, suggested that the Langendoen and Postal (1984) argument about the doubling relativization construction may be correct (all these arguments deal with English). 
GPSG aims for grammars that generate context-free languages (though there is some recent wavering on this point; see Pullum 1984); LFG, for languages that are at worst context-sensitive.

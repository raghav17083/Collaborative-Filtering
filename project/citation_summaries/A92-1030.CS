The "derivation checkers" or tree editors of (Calder, 1993) and (Paroubek et al, 1992) can be viewed as a mode in which each action by a user is verified for consistency with respect to a grammar. 
The XTAG system consists of a morphological analyzer, a part-ofspeech tagger, a wide-coverage LTAG English grammar, a predictive left-to-right Early-style parser for LTAG (Schabes, 1990) and an X-windows interface for grammar development (Paroubek et al. , 1992). 
One response, as seen in the tree editors described by (Paroubek et al, 1992) and by (Calder, 1993) and in the feature structure editor designed by (Kieffer and Fettig, 1995), is to fix a relatively small amount of graphical devices and restrict the operations defined over, and potential combinations of, those devices (perhaps to the extent that only operations which don't violate consistency with respect to a particular grammar are allowed). 
There are already other grammar developing tools, such as a grammar writer of XTAG (Paroubek et al. , 1992), ALEP (Schmidt et al. , 1996), ConTroll (Gotz and Meurers, 1997), a tool by Nara Institute of Science and Technology (Miyata et al. , 1999), and [incr tsdb()] (Oepen et al. , 2002). 
They follow each other in a rigid order: nora < refl < ace < dat < y <en, and are subject to numerous corcstrictions3: no identical l. It is also the basis of an interactive NLF' enviromnent (Paroubek et al. 1992).

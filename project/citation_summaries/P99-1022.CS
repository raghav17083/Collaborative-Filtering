For example, Florian and Yarowsky (1999) proposed the following model: t (9) where t denotes a topic id. Topics are obtained by hierarchical clustering from a training corpus, and a topic-specific language model, Pt, is learned from the clustered documents. 
We evaluated several similarity functions for topic modeling, initially using the cosine measure for similarity scoring and scaling the scores to be a probability distribution, following Florian and Yarowsky (1999). 
Traditionally, document clusters are used for topics, where some researchers use hand-crafted clusters (Trnka et al., 2006; Lesher and Rinkus, 2001) and others use automatic clustering (Florian and Yarowsky, 1999). 
We found it useful to polarize the similarity scores, following Florian and Yarowsky (1999), who found that transformations on cosine similarity reduced perplexity. 
Neighbors are an extension of Florian & Yarowsky (1999), who used topic clustering to build a language model for contexts such as: "It is at least on the Serb side a real setback to lhe x".

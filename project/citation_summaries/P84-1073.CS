Although Tomita (1984:357) anticipates LR parsing techniques being applied to large NL grammars written in formalisms such as GPSG, the sizes of parse tables for such grammars grow more rapidly than he predicts.


The next subsection describes the idea of stack combination, which was introduced in the author's earlier research (Tomita 1984), to make the algorithm much more efficient.

As the particles in verb + particle MWVs are often intransitive (Baldwin and Villavicencio, 2002; McCarthy et al. , 2003), which are different from the transitive prepositions followed by a noun chunk, we use this feature and a nearest assumption to extract non-contiguous MWV candidates. 
Directly related to our work is the development of a statistical MWE tool at Lancaster for searching and identifying English MWEs in running text (Piao et al. , 2003, 2005).

3.2 Extraction of Contiguous MWV Candidates A number of works about MWV extraction from corpora are based on the output of a POS tagger and a chunker (Baldwin and Villavicencio, 2002; Bannard et al. , 2003), or the output of a parser (McCarthy et al. , 2003).

Some partial parsing approaches have been coupled with a post-parsing repair stage (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995; Ros6 and Waibel, 1994; Ros6, 1997; Van Noord, 1997; Kasper et al. , 1999) The goal behind these two stage approaches is to increase the coverage over partial parsing alone at a reasonable computational cost.

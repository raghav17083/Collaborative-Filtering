We have achieved average results in the CoNLL domain adaptation track open submission (Marcus et al. , 1993; Johansson and Nugues, 2007; Kulick et al. , 2004; MacWhinney, 2000; Brown, 1973). 
We discarded all other entity annotations originally contained in the corpus assigning the OUTSIDE class.2 The first data set (PBIO) is based on the annotations of the PENNBIOIE corpus for biomedical entity extraction (Kulick et al., 2004). 
Both the GENIA corpus (Kim et al. , 2003) and the BioIE cytochrome P450 corpus (Kulick et al. , 2004) come with named entity annotations that include a proportion of chemicals, and at least a few abstracts that are recognisable as chemistry abstracts. 
In the domain adaptation track, participants were provided with English training data from the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993) converted to dependencies (Johansson and Nugues, 2007) to train parsers to be evaluated on material in the biological (development set) and chemical (test set) domains (Kulick et al. , 2004), and optionally on text from the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000; Brown, 1973). 
A current project at the University of Pennsylvania and the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia (Kulick et al. 2004) is producing a corpus that follows many of these basic principles.

If we ignore this unnecessary complication (along with one other) here, the enabling states for ~PROX may be listed as follows, where "I" denotes an instrumental device (such as a shopping cart) used for means M~ a) PROX(A,Z)--the actor must be at the starting point; b) PROX(X,Z)--the object is at the same starting point; c) HAVE(I,A)--the actor must have instrumental device; the d) UNIT(X,I)--the object must be in a "unit relation" with the instrumental device; e) OKFOR(I,M)--the device must be in good condition for the transportation means~ These enablements are very general~ They must be satisfied no matter what the content~ Perhaps the level of generality is too high, so that some of the states such as OKFOR may have a feeling of kluge about them (as Rieger (1975b) wonders), but this is not a problem for other states such as UNIT which have rather clean properties.


THE REASONER AND THE INFERENCER DON'T TALK MUCH TO EACH OTHER Robert P. Abelson Yale University In this paper, I wish to point out an important problem which has largely escaped notice in the field(s) of natural language processing~ Curiously, it is implicit in the topic title of this session, "Reasoning and Inference"~ The fact that two terms were used in the title instead of one implies a meaningful distinction between two different types of intelligent processing~ The dictionary definitions of reasoning and inference are not much help in making a sharp distinction, but in actual use in artificial intelligence work these are two quite different traditions, each laying claim to one of the terms~ Reasoning refers to the processing of abstract propositions to reach abstract conclusions~ Reasoning is formal; it is based on the use of logical or mathematical rules, or special devices in a particular problem-solving domain~ Inferencing, on the other hand, refers to the processing of concrete facts to reach concrete conclusions~ It is informal and "common-sensical" (whatever we quite mean by that)~ It includes the curren~ vein of work on "frames" (Minsky, 1974; Winograd, 1975) or "scripts" (Schank & Abelson, 1975) or "conceptual overlays" (Rieger, 1975a) in which input patterns are matched to big memory structures from which further expectations are read out~ It is conceivable that one of these two approaches is "right" and the other "wrong".

To avoid this pitfall, Talbot and Osborne (2006) use a datadriven approach to cluster source-language morphological variants that are meaningless in the target language, and Yang and Kirchhoff (2006) propose the use of a backoff model that uses morphologically reduced forms only when the translation of the surface form is unavailable. 
(2006) and Talbot and Osborne (2006) for Czech), however, they focus on translating from the highly inflectional language. 
We first generate a representation that contains both the lexical segments and the morphological features encoded for all possible segmenta1This is in a sense very similar to the more general problem of lexical redundancy addressed by Talbot and Osborne (2006) but our approach does not require the more sophisticated solution there. 
With different training corpus sizes, they focus on translation into English from Arabic (Lee, 2004; Habash and Sadat, 2006; Zollmann et al., 2006), Czech (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005; Talbot and Osborne, 2006), German (Nieen and Ney, 2004) or Catalan, Spanish and Serbian (Popovic and Ney, 2004). 
Our framework is more general and goes beyond recent work on models that back off to representations with richer statistics (Nieen and Ney, 2001; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006; Talbot and Osborne, 2006) by keeping a more complex representation throughout the translation process.

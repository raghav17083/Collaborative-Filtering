While contextual information is the primary source of information used in WSD research and has been used for acquiring semantic lexicons and classifying unknown words in other languages (e.g. , Roark and Charniak 1998; Ci190 aramita 2003; Curran 2005), it has been used in only one previous study on semantic classification of Chinese unknown words (Chen and Lin, 2000). 
grained distinctions of WN (Hearst and Schutze, 1993) (Peters et al. , 1998) (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001) (Agirre et al. , 2003) and on using predefined sets of sense-groupings for learning class-based classifiers for WSD (Segond et al. , 1997) (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003) (Villarejo et al. , 2005) (Curran, 2005) (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006). 
There are, however, approaches to the complementary problem of determining the closest known sense for unknown words (Widdows, 2003; Curran, 2005; Burchardt et al. , 2005), which can be viewed as the logical next step after unknown sense detection.

Previous work on prediction at the supersense level(CiaramitaandJohnson, 2003; Curran, 2005) has focused on lexical acquisition (nouns exclusively), thus aiming at word type classification rather than tagging.

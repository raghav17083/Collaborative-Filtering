Context-based approach, which is based on the observation that a term and its translation appear in similar lexical contexts (Daille and Morin, 2008), is the most popular approach for extracting bilingual dictionary from comparable corpora and has shown its effectiveness in terminology extraction (Fung, 2000; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; Robitaille et al., 2006; Morin et al., 2007).


Therefore, many researchers paid attention to bilingual dictionary extraction from comparable corpora (Fung, 2000; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; Daille and Morin, 2008; Robitaille et al., 2006; Morin et al., 2007; Otero, 2008), in which texts are not exact translation of each other but share common features.


After that, researchers extended context heterogeneity vector to context vector with the aid of an existing bilingual dictionary (Fung, 2000; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; Robitaille et al., 2006; Morin et al., 2007; Daille and Morin, 2008).


For instance, (Morin et al., 2007) have achieved 30% and 42% precision for the top 10 and top 20 candidates in a 0.84 million-word French-Japanese corpus.

F. Smadja, From N-Grams to Collocations an evaluation of XTRACT, in (ACL,1991). 
Following Smadja (1991a) we define precision as the number of correctly found collocations divided by the number of V-N combinations found at all. 
As illustrated in the la. ,~t paragraph the assumption that a "semantic agent \[\] is principally used before the verb" and a "'semantic object \[\] is used after it" as described in Smadja (1991a:180) does not hold for German.

German have been studied by Koehn and Knight (2003). 
compound splitting  We split German compound words (mostly nouns), based on the frequency of the words in the potential decompositions (Koehn and Knight, 2003a). 
We wanted to test the following hypotheses: ??Translation models based on lemmas will improve translation quality (Popovi and Ney, 2004) ??Decompounding German nominal compounds will improve translation quality (Koehn and Knight, 2003) ??Re-ordering models based on word forms and parts-of-speech will improve translation quality (Zens and Ney, 2006). 
Koehn and Knight (2003) proposed a splitting method for German compounds and showed that it improves statistical machine translation. 
By randomly sampling keywords we would get few compounds (as their frequency is small compared to that of non-compounds), so we have proceeded in the following way to ensure that the gold-standards contain a substantial amount of compounds: we started by building a very naive decompounder that splits a word in several parts using a frequency-based compound splitting method (Koehn and Knight, 2003).

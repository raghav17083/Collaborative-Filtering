For example, the Pinchak and Lin (2006) model is forced to consider a question focus context (such as X is a city) to be of equal importance to non-focus contexts (such as X host Olympics). 
We use the model of Pinchak and Lin (2006) to produce features for our discriminative model. 
4 Experiments To compare with the prior approach of Pinchak and Lin (2006), we use a set of what and which questions with question focus (questions with a noun phrase following the wh-word). 
Unfortunately, Pinchak and Lin (2006) use a brittle generative model when combining question contexts that assumes all contexts are equally important.

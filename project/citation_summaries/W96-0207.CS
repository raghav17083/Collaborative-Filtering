Transformation-based learning has also been successfully applied to text chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), morphological disambiguation (Oflazer and Tur, 1996), and phrase parsing (Vilain and Day, 1996). 
This unknown word processor has a (nominal) root lexicon which recognizes S +, where S is the Turkish surface alphabet (in the two-level morphology sense), but then tries to interpret an arbitrary postfix string of the unknown word, as a sequence of Turkish suffixes subject to all morphographemic constraints (Oflazer and Tfir, 1996). 
Previous ai)proaches to morphological dismnbiguation of Turkish text; had employed a constraintbased approach (Otlazer and KuruSz, 1994; Oflazer and Tiir, 1996; Oflazer and Tiir, 1997). 
This is the reason why we try to avoid conventional guessing rules using word morphology features such as those proposed in Mikheev (1996) and Oflazer and T ur (1996). 
The convenience of adding new rules in without worrying about where exactly it goes in terms of rule ordering (something that hampered our progress in our earlier work on disambiguating Turkish morphology (Oflazer and KuruSz, 1994; Oflazer and Tiir, 1996)), has also been a key positive point.

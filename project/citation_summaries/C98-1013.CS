PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) and FrameNet (Baker et al. , 1998) are large English corpora annotated with the semantic relations of words in a sentence. 
BerkeleycjkA1AFs FrameNet project, (Baker et al. , 1998; Fillmore and Atkins, 1998; Johnson et al. , 2002) is committed to producing rich semantic frames on which the annotation is based, but it is less concerned with annotating complete texts, concentrating instead on annotating a set of examples for each predicator (including verbs, nouns and adjectives), and attempting to describe the network of relations among the semantic frames. 
A third of this is syntactically parsed as part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1993) and has dialog act annotation (Shriberg et al. , 1998). 
Because Grosz et al. do not provide a definition of utterance, the vanilla instantiation incorporates the hypothesis from Kameyama (1998) that utterances are finite clauses and the characterization of previous utterance proposed there. 
Other than the English FrameNet (Baker et al, 1998), we also note the construction of the Spanish FrameNet (Subirats & Petruck, 2003), the Japanese FrameNet (Ikeda 1998), and the German FrameNet (Boas, 2002).

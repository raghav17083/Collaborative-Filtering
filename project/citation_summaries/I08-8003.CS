More recently, (Finch and Sumita, 2008b) proposed a transliteration method that is based directly on techniques developed for phrasebased SMT, and transforms a character sequence from one language into another in a subwordlevel, character-based manner. 
In contrast to (Finch and Sumita, 2008b) where external dictionaries and inter-language links in Wikipedia2 are utilized, the transliteration training examples used for the experiments in Section 4 are extracted directly from the phrasetable of the baseline SMT systems trained on the provided data sets. 
In order to adapt SMT systems to a speci c domain, recent research focuses on model adaptation techniques that adjust their parameters based on information about the evaluation domain (Foster and Kuhn, 2007; Finch and Sumita, 2008a). 
For example, the cognate pair evolucao  evolucion became  e v o l u c a o $   e v o l u c i o n $ We randomly split the resulting list into a training (26,725 pairs) and a development dataset (2,000 pairs), and trained and tuned a characterlevel phrase-based monotone SMT system similar to (Finch and Sumita, 2008) to transliterate a Portuguese wordform into a Spanish wordform. 
In this paper, we apply a phrase-based transliteration approach similar to the one proposed in (Finch and Sumita, 2008b).

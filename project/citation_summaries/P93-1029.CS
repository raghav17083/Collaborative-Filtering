Wittenburg et al (1991) employ a unification-based grammar formalism augmented with functional con straints (F-PATR, Wittenburg 1993), and a bottomup, incremental, Earley-style (l:;arley 1970) tabular parsing algorithm.


Tim addition of functional constraints is common in tlPSG and other unification grammar formalisms (Wittenburg 1993).

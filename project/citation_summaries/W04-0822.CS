388 3 The WSD system The WSD system used for the experiments is based on the model that achieved the best performance, by a large margin, on the Senseval-3 Chinese lexical sample task (Carpuat et al. , 2004). 
The same system also participated in the Senseval-3 lexical sample tasks for Chinese and English, as well as the Multilingual lexical sample task (Carpuat et al. , 2004). 
4 The WSD system The WSD system used here is based on the model that achieved the best performance on the Senseval-3 Chinese lexical sample task, outperforming other systems by a large margin (Carpuat et al. , 2004). 
Like the boosting model, the maximum entropy system also participated in the Senseval-3 lexical sample tasks for Chinese and English, as well as the Multilingual lexical sample task (Carpuat et al. , 2004). 
4.4 The WSD system The word sense disambiguation subsystem is modeled after the best performing WSD system in the Chinese lexical sample task at Senseval-3 (Carpuat et al. , 2004).

As discussed in the introduction, it has already been shown that for any PCFG G, there are equivalent PPDTs implementing these strategies, as reported in (Abney et al. , 1999) and (Tendeau, 1995), respectively. 
4 Renormalization In this section we recall a renormalization technique for PCFGs that was used before in (Abney et al. , 1999), (Chi, 1999) and (Nederhof and Satta, 2003) for different purposes, and is exploited in the next section to prove our main results. 
Similarly, with context free languages, (Abney et al. , 1999) showed that converting between two parametrisations of models for stochastic context free languages are equivalent but that there are blow-ups in both directions. 
Transitionbased approaches solve a sequence of local problems in sequence, sacrificing global optimality guarantees and possibly expressive power (Abney et al., 1999). 
Some first results on this issue have been presented by (Tendeau, 1995), who shows that the already mentioned left-corner parsing strategy can be extended probabilistically, and later by (Abney et al. , 1999) who show that the pure top-down parsing strategy and a specific type of shift-reduce parsing strategy can be probabilistically extended.

The Regulus platform, on which MedSLT is based, supports rapid construction of complex grammar-based language models; it uses an example-based method driven by small corpora of disambiguated parsed examples (Rayner et al. , 2003; Rayner et al. , 2006), which extracts most of the structure of the model from a general linguistically motivated resource grammar. 
Our unusual focus means that we can not readily take advantage of software toolkits such as NLTK (Loper and Bird, 2002) or Regulus (Rayner et al. , 2003). 
The basic idea behind Regulus (Regulus, 2005; Rayner et al. , 2003) is to extract grammar-based language models from a single large unification grammar, using example-based methods driven by small corpora. 
Some popular options include the NLTK (Loper and Bird, 2002), CSLU (Cole, 1999), Trindi (Larsson and Traum, 2000) and Regulus (Rayner et al. , 2003) toolkits.

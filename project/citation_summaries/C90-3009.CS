E91-1023:2	60:209	INTERCALATION IN ARABIC VERB MORPHOLOGY A number of linguistic descriptions and computational implementations have treated various aspects of Arabic verb conjugation (McCarthy 1982, Hudson 1984, Kay 1987, Calder 1989, Cahill 1990, Bird 1990, Gibbon 1990).
---------------------------------------------------
E91-1023:3	107:209	These include two-level morphology with continuation lexica and two-level rules (Koskenniemi 1983), its derivates with feature-based lexicon and two-level rules (Karttunen 1987, Bear 1986, Trost 1990), and Cahill's DATR-driven morphology with phonological descriptions in MOLUSC (1990).
---------------------------------------------------
E91-1023:4	19:209	Other approaches rely on lists of stem variants, string permutations, or string position indices (Cahill 1990).

P95-1011:5	32:190	Following LTAG conventions (for the time being), the node labels here are gross syntactic category specifications to which additional featural information may be added 5, and are annotated to indicate node type: <> indicates an anchor node, and I indicates a substitution node (where a 3See, for example, Bleiching (1992; 1994), Brown & Hippisley (1994), Corbett & Fraser (1993), Cahill (1990; 1993), Cahill &: Evans (1990), Fraser &= Corbett (in press), Gibbon (1992), Kilgarriff (1993), Kilgarriff & Gazdar (1995), Reinhard & Gibbon (1991).

W91-0209:6	139:199	We can regard morphological rules as a particular type of lexical rule where the orthography of the output is not equal to that of the input (we assume that the regular spelling changes involved in affixation will be dealt with by a separate system, e.g. Cahill, 1990).

J94-3010:7	38:498	Moreover, some recent thinking on the phonology-phonetics interface supports this view (Pierrehumbert 1990; Coleman 2 (Bach and Wheeler 1981; Wheeler 1981; Bird 1990; Cahill 1990; Coleman 1991; Scobbie 1991; Bird 1992; Walther 1992; Mastroianni 1993; Russell 1993) 456 Steven Bird and Ewan Klein Phonological Analysis in Typed Feature Systems 1992).

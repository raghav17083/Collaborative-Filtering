3 TRANSLATION DELIVERY SYSTEM Results of multi-engine MT were fed in our experiment into a translator's workstation (TWS) (Cohen et al. , 1993), through which a translator either approved the system's output or modified it. 
IIowever, (Dagan et al. , 1993) have shown that knowledge of target-text length is not crucial to the model's i)ertbrmanee. 
Other technologies such as lexical-transfer MT (Nirenburg et al. , 1995; Frederking and Brown, 1996; MacDonald, 1963), and Example-Based MT (EBMT) (Brown, 1996; Na61 gao, 1984: Sato and Nagao, 1990) provide lowerquality general-purpose translations, unless they are incorporated into human-assisted MT systems (Frederking et al. , 1993; Melby, 1983), but can be used in non-domain-restricted translation applications. 
This conclusion is supported by the fact that true IMT is not, to our knowledge, used in most modern translator's support environments, eg (Eurolang, 1995; I,'rederking et al. , 1993; IBM, 1995; Kugler et al. , 1991; Nirenburg, 1992; ~li'ados, 1995). 
2 INTEGRATING MULTI-ENGINE OUTPUT In our experiment we used three MT engines: * a knowledge-based MT (KBMT) system, the mainline Pangloss engine (Frederking et al. , 1993b);  an example-based MT (EBMT) system (see (Nirenburg et al. , 1993; Nirenburg et al. , 1994b); the original idea is due to Nagao (Nagao, 1984)); and  a lexical transfer system, fortified with morphological analysis and synthesis modules and relying on a number of databases -a machine-readable dictionary (the Collins Spanish/English), the lexicons used by the KBMT modules, a large set of user-generated bilingual glossaries as well as a gazetteer and a list of proper and organization names.

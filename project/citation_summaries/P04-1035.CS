SVM has been shown to be useful for text classification tasks (Joachims, 1998), and has previously given good performance in sentiment classification experiments (Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006; Mullen and Collier, 2004; Pang and Lee, 2004; Pang et al., 2002).

Sentiment analysis includes a variety of different problems, including: sentiment classification techniques to classify reviews as positive or negative, based on bag of words (Pang et al. , 2002) or positive and negative words (Turney, 2002; Mullen and Collier, 2004); classifying sentences in a document as either subjective or objective (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004); identifying or classifying appraisal targets (Nigam and Hurst, 2004); identifying the source of an opinion in a text (Choi et al. , 2005), whether the author is expressing the opinion, or whether he is attributing the opinion to someone else; and developing interactive and visual opinion mining methods (Gamon et al. , 2005; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005).

This transducer always adopts an "onward" form, in which the output substrings are assigned to the edges in such a way that they are as "close" to the initial state as they can be (see Oncina et al. , 1993 \[15\], Reutenauer, 1990 \[22\]; for a recent reelaboration of these concepts see Mohri, 1997 \[13\]).

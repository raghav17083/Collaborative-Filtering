Citation texts have also been used to create summaries of single scientific articles in Qazvinian and Radev (2008) and Mei and Zhai (2008).


By analyzing rhetorical discourse structure of aim, background, solution, etc. or citation context, we can obtain appropriate abstracts and the most influential contents from scientific articles (Teufel and Moens, 2002; Mei and Zhai, 2008).

Wang and Waibel (1997) presents a search algorithm for the IBM-2 translation model based on the A  concept and multiple stacks. 
If we assign a probability a15a17a16a19a18 a12 a13a7a21a20a4a6a5a7a23a22 to each pair of strings a18 a12a14a13a7a25a24 a4 a5a7 a22, then according to Bayes decision rule, we have to choose the target string that maximizes the product of the target language model a15a17a16a19a18 a12a14a13a7 a22 and the string translation model a15a17a16a19a18a26a4a6a5 a7 a20 a12 a13 a7 a22 . Many existing systems for statistical machine translation (Berger et al. , 1994; Wang and Waibel, 1997; Tillmann et al. , 1997; Nieen et al. , 1998) make use of a special way of structuring the string translation model like proposed by (Brown et al. , 1993): The correspondence between the words in the source and the target string is described by alignments that assign one target word position to each source word position. 
1.3 Search in Statistical Machine Translation In the last few years, there has been a number of papers considering the problem of finding an efficient search procedure (Wu, 1996), (Tillmann et al., 1997a), (Tillmann et al., 1997b), (Wang and Waibel, 1997). 
Heuristic functions for search in statistical MT have been used in Wang and Waibel (1997) and Och, Ueffing, and Ney (2001). 
If we assign a probability a13a15a14a17a16 a10a12a11a5a19a18a2 a3a5a21a20 to each pair of strings a16 a10 a11a5a12a22 a2a4a3a5 a20, then according to Bayes decision rule, we have to choose the English string that maximizes the product of the English language model a13a23a14a24a16 a10 a11a5 a20 and the string translation model a13a15a14a17a16a25a2 a3a5a26a18a10a27a11a5a28a20 . Many existing systems for statistical machine translation (Wang and Waibel, 1997; Nieen et al. , 1998; Och and Weber, 1998) make use of a special way of structuring the string translation model like proposed by (Brown et al. , 1993): The correspondence between the words in the source and the target string is described by alignments which assign one target word position to each source word position.

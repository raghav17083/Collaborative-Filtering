Adler et al.(2008a) use the lexicon to learn a Maximum Entropy model for predicting possible analyses for unknown tokens based on their orthography, thus extending the lexicon to cover (even if noisily) any unknown token. 
The KC tagset (Adler et al., 2008b; Netzer et al., 2007; Adler, 2007) takes a lexical approach to POS tagging (a word can assume only POS tags that would be assigned to it in a dictionary), while the TB takes a syntactic one (if the word in this particular positions functions as an Adverb, tag it as an Adverb, even though it is listed in the dictionary only as a Noun). 
This task has been tackled in (Adler et al., 2008) for modern Hebrew, and in (Linden, 2008) for Finnish. 
Roughly 1,500 unique tokens from the Hebrew Treebank cannot be assigned any analysis by the KC Lexicon, and Adler et al.(2008a) report that roughly 4.5% of the tokens in a 42M tokens corpus of news text are unknown to the Lexicon. 
Tagsets Comparison In (Adler et al., 2008b), we hypothesized that due to its syntax-based nature, the Treebank morphological tagset is more suitable than the KC one for syntax related tasks.

This has been shown both in supervised settings (Roth and Yih, 2004; Riedel and Clarke, 2006) and unsupervised settings (Haghighi and Klein, 2006; Chang et al., 2007) in which constraints are used to bootstrap the model. 
Haghighi and Klein (2006) develop a prototype-driven approach, which requires just a few prototype examples for each POS tag and exploits these labeled words to constrain the labels of their distributionally similar words. 
This is the scenario considered by Haghighi and Klein (2006) for POS tagging: how to construct an accurate tagger given a set of tags and a few example words for each of those tags. 
This type of input information (features + majority label) is a powerful and flexible model for specifying alternative inputs to a classifier, and has been additionally used by Haghighi and Klein (2006). 
Haghighi and Klein s (2006) prototype-driven approach requires just a few prototype examples for each POS tag, exploiting these labeled words to constrain the labels of their distributionally similar words when training a generative log-linear model for POS tagging.

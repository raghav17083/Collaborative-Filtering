---------------------------------------------------
E06-2025:2	14:84	Despite this empirical success, (Johnson, 2002) argued that it is inadequate because it is biased and inconsistent.
---------------------------------------------------
E06-2025:3	23:84	In his critique of this method, (Johnson, 2002) considers a situation where there is an STSG G (the target grammar) with a specific set of subtrees (t1tN) and specific values of the weights (w1 wN) . He evaluates an estimation procedure which produces a grammar Gprime (the estimated grammar), by looking at the difference between the weights of G and the expected weights of Gprime.
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1039:4	67:191	An additional problem is that, as described in (Johnson, 2002), the relative frequency estimator for DOP 373 (and by extension, DOT) is known to be biased and inconsistent.
---------------------------------------------------
N09-1062:5	16:209	However, many of the DOP estimation methods have serious shortcomings (Johnson, 2002), namely inconsistency for DOP1 (Bod, 2003) and overfitting of the maximum likelihood estimate (Prescher et al., 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
N09-1062:6	36:209	mate (Bod, 2000; Bod, 2003; Johnson, 2002).
---------------------------------------------------
D07-1058:7	31:308	This is one reason why the relative frequency estimator for DOP is inconsistent (Johnson, 2002).
---------------------------------------------------
W06-2912:8	94:174	1 As in Bod (2003) and Goodman (2003: 136), we additionally use a correction factor to redress DOP's bias discussed in Johnson (2002).
---------------------------------------------------
W06-2912:9	89:174	It should be kept in mind that while the probabilities of all parse trees generated by DOP sum up to 1, these probabilities do not converge to the "true" probabilities if the corpus grows to infinity (Johnson 2002).
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1037:10	48:224	The heuristic method is inconsistent in the limit (Johnson, 2002) while EM is degenerate, placing disproportionate probability mass on the largest rules in order to describe the data with as few a rules as possible (DeNero et al., 2006).
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1109:11	18:166	Johnson (2002: 76) argues in favor of a maximum likelihood estimator for DOP which is statistically consistent.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1109:12	29:166	Although it is now known that DOP1's relative frequency estimator is statistically inconsistent (Johnson 2002), the model yields excellent empirical results and has been used in state-of-the-art systems.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1109:13	16:166	A possible drawback of U-DOP, however, is the statistical inconsistency of its estimator (Johnson 2002) which is inherited from the DOP1 model (Bod 1998).
---------------------------------------------------
P07-1051:14	33:173	While efficient algorithms have been developed for this DOP model by converting it into a PCFG reduction (Goodman 2003), DOPs estimator was shown to be inconsistent by Johnson (2002).
---------------------------------------------------
P02-1034:15	179:185	From a theoretical point of view, it is difficult to find motivation for the parameter estimation methods used by (Bod 1998)  see (Johnson 2002) for discussion.

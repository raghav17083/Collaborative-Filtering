4 Packed Charts Geman and Johnson (2002) have proposed a dynamic programming estimation method for packed representations of unification-based parses. 
To cope with this problem, we applied an efficient algorithm of maximum entropy estimation for feature forests (Miyao and Tsujii, 2002; Geman and Johnson, 2002). 
To make the model estimation tractable, Geman and Johnson (Geman and Johnson, 2002) and Miyao and Tsujii (Miyao and Tsujii, 2002) proposed a dynamic programming algorithm for estimating p(T|w). 
Nevertheless, for some models, such as most parsing models, these exponential labelings can be compactly represented in a packed form, e.g., (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1995; Crouch, 2005), and subsequent stages can be reengineered to work over these packed representations, e.g., (Geman and Johnson, 2002). 
To cope with this, we adopted an algorithm of maximum entropy estimation for feature forests (Miyao and Tsujii, 2002; Geman and Johnson, 2002), which allows parameters to be efficiently estimated.

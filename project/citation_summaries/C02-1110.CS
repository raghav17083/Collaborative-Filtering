Yapex system (Olsson et al. , 2002) is adopted to propose candidates, and collocates are served as restrictions to filter out less possible protein names. 
Previous approaches on biological named entities extraction can be classified into two types  say, rule-based (Fukuda, et al. , 1998; Humphreys, et al. , 2000; Olsson, et al. , 2002) and corpus-based (Collier, et al. , 2000). 
Named entities like protein names, gene names, drug names, disease names, and so on, were recognized (Collier, et al. , 2000; Fukuda, et al. , 1998; Olsson, et al. , 2002; Rindflesch, et al. , 2000). 
Previous approaches on biological named entity extraction can be classified into two types  rule based (Fukuda et al. , 1998; Olsson et al. , 2002; Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002) and corpus-based (Collier et al. , 2000; Chang et al. , 2004). 
Therefore, we employed Yapex (Olsson et al. , 2002) and GAPSCORE (Chang et al. , 2004) protein/gene name detectors to count the number of protein/gene names in each of the 9 sentences, resulting in 94,581 features.

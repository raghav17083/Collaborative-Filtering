Other prosodic cues (e.g. , pitch contour, energy) have been studied for their correlation with story segments in read speech (Tur et al. , 2001; Levow, 2004; Christensen et al. , 2005) and with theory-based discourse segments in spontaneous speech (e.g. , directiongiven monologue) (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). 
(Tur et al. , 2001) applied both a prosody-only and a mixed text-prosody model to segmentation of TDT English broadcast news, with the best results combining text and prosodic features. 
In work on segmentation of spoken documents, intonational, prosodic, and acoustic indicators are used to detect topic boundaries (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Nakatani et al. , 1995; Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996; Passonneau and Litman, 1997; Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1998; Beeferman et al. , 1999; Tur et al. , 2001). 
(Tur et al. , 2001) applied both a prosody-only and a mixed text-prosody model to segmentation of TDT English broadcast news, with the best results combining text and prosodic features. 
Segmentation of stories in BN have included some acoustic features (Shriberg et al. , 2000; Tcurrency1ur et al. , 2001).

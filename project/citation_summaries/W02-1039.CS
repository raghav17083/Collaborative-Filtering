However, the experiments conducted in (Fox, 2002) indicate that dependency trees demonstrate a higher degree of phrasal cohesion during translation than other structures. 
Fox (2002) collected the statistics mainly on French and English data: in dependency representations, the percentage of head crossings per chance (case [b] in the graph) is 12.62%. 
This suggests that reordering words by phrasal movement is a reasonable strategy (Fox, 2002). 
With these definitions of phrase and head spans, we define two notions of overlap, originally introduced in (Fox, 2002) as crossings.

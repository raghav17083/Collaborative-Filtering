(Elzer, Chu-Carroli et al. 1994; Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1998) studied the generation of evaluative arguments in the context of collaborative planning dialogues. 
3 Communicating an Expression of Doubt We assume appropriate mechmfisms for detecting conflict and determining when to engage in a subdialogue by expressing doul)t(Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 1998), as well as an approi)riate belief revision mechmfism, and in this paper concentrate on how an expression of doubt should be realized as an utteranee. 
1 Introduction Collaboration in dialogue has long been researched in computational linguistics (Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 1998; Constantino-Gonzalez and Suthers, 2000; Jordan and Di Eugenio, 1997; Lochbaum and Sidner, 1990; Soller, 2004; Vizcano, 2005), however, the study of peer learning from a computational perspective is still in the early stages. 
The human judges evaluation method requires a panel of judges to score outputs of generation models (Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1998; Lester and Porter March 1997). 
If the doubted agent decides to retain his original beliet:s, this information helps him to construct an argument that will be maximally effective and efficient in his attempt to convince the doubting agent(Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 1998).

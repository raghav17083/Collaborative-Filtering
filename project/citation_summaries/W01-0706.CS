We follow Li and Roth (2001) in using chunklink to also convert trees output by a context-free parser into a flat representation of shallow constituents. 
Our performance falls 0.6 percentage points below the best published result on the CoNLL-2000 task, and 0.5 percentage points above the performance by Li and Roth (2001) on their task. 
For chunking algorithm, many machine learning (ML) methods have been applied and got promising results after chunking is represented as tagging problem, such as: SVM (Kudoh and Matsumoto, 2001), Memory-based (Bosch and Buchholz, 2002), SNoW (Li and Roth), et al Some rule-base chunking (Kinyon, 2003) and combining rules with learning (Park and Zhang, 2003) are also reported. 
In addition to the clear efficiency benefit of shallow parsing, Li and Roth (2001) have further claimed both an accuracy and a robustness benefit versus context-free parsing. 
In the trials reported in Li and Roth (2001), both of the evaluated systems were provided with reference POS tags from the Switchboard Treebank.

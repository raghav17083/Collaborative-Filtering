For example, in the case of estimation from comparable corpora, (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999) proposed standard techniques of estimating bilingual term correspondences from comparable corpora. 
Our approach The work of (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) noted that if an English word e is the translation of a Chinese word c, then the contexts of the two words are similar. 
This idea is similar to Rapp (1999) who proposed to transform all co-occurrence vectors using log likelihood ratio instead of just using the frequency counts of the co-occurrences. 
The proposed two-stages approach for the acquisition, disambiguation and selection of bilingual terminology is described as follows: Bilingual terminology acquisition from source language to target language to yield a first translation model, represented by similarity SIMS!T. Bilingual terminology acquisition from target language to source language to yield a second translation model, represented by similarity SIMT!S. Merge the first and second models to yield a two-stages translation model, based on bidirectional comparable corpora and represented by similarity SIMS$T . We follow strategies of previous researches (Dejean et al. , 2002; Fung, 2000; Rapp, 1999) for the first and second translation models and propose a merging strategy for the two-stages translation model (Sadat et al. , 2003).

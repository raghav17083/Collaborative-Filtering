Although systems basedoninformationextraction(RadevandMcKeown 1998,Whiteetal.2001,McKeownetal.2002)anddiscourseanalysis(Marcu1999b,Strzalkowskietal.1999) alsoexist,wefocusourstudyonthepotentialandlimitationsofsentenceextractionsystemswiththehopethat ourresultswillfurtherprogressinmostoftheautomatic textsummarizationsystemsandevaluationsetup.

The idea is to measure the content similarity betweenasystemextractandamanualsummaryusing simple n-gram overlap. A similar idea called IBM BLEU score has proved successful in automatic machinetranslationevaluation(Papinenietal.2001,NIST 2002).Forsummarization,wecanexpressthedegreeof contentoverlapintermsofn-grammatchesasthefollowingequation: )1( )( )( }{ }{       = UnitsModelCCgramn UnitsModelCCgramn match n gramnCount gramnCount C  Modelunitsaresegmentsof manual summaries.They are typically either sentences or elementary discourse unitsasdefinedbyMarcu(1999b).Count match (n-gram) is the maximum number of n-grams co-occurring in a systemextractandamodelunit.Count(n-gram)isthe number of n-grams in the model unit.

Withatestcollectionavailableandanautomaticscoring metric defined, we describe the experimental setup in thenextsection. 4 ExperimentalDesigns As stated in the introduction, we aim to find the performanceupperboundofasentenceextractionsystem andtheeffectofcompressionratioonitsperformance. We present our experimental designs to address these questionsinthefollowingsections. 4.1 Performance Upper Bound Estimation UsingOracleExtract Inordertoestimatethepotentialofsentenceextraction systems,itisimportanttoknowtheupperboundthatan ideal sentence extraction method might achieve and howfarthestate-of-the-artsystemsareawayfromthe bound. If the upper bound is close to state-of-the-art systems performance then we need to look for other summarizationmethodstoimproveperformance.Ifthe upper bound is much higher than any current systems canachieve,thenitisreasonabletoinvestmoreeffortin sentence extraction methods. The question is how to estimatetheperformanceupperbound.Oursolutionis tocastthisestimationproblemasanoptimizationproblem. We exhaustively generate all possible sentence combinationsthatsatisfygivenlengthconstraintsfora summary, for example, all the sentence combinations totaling 1005 words. We then compute the unigram co-occurrence score for each sentence combination, against the ideal. The best combinations are the ones withthehighestunigramco-occurrencescore.Wecall this sentence combination the oracle extract. Figure 1 showsanoracleextractfordocumentAP900424-0035.

That situation provides the best achievable unigram co-occurrence score.Anearoptimalscorealsoconfirmsthevalidityof usingtheunigramco-occurrencescoringmethodasan automaticevaluationmethod.  4.2 Compression Ratio and Its Effect on System Performance Oneimportantfactorthat affectsthe averageperformance of sentence extraction system is the number of sentences contained in the original documents. This factorisoftenoverlookedandhasneverbeenaddressed systematically. For example, if a document contains onlyonesentencethenthisdocumentwillnotbeuseful indifferentiatingsummarizationsystemperformance there is only one choice. However, for a document of 100sentencesandassumingeachsentenceis20words long, there are C(100,5) = 75,287,520 different 100wordextracts.Thishugesearchspacelowersthechance of agreement between humans on what constitutes a good summary.

Howdoesastate-of-the-artsystemdifferfrom averagehumanperformanceatdifferentinterhumanagreementlevels? We present our results in the next section using 303 newspaperarticlesfromtheDUC2001singledocument summarizationtask.Besidestheoriginaldocuments,we also have three human summaries, one lead summary (B1), and one automatic summary from one top performingsystem(T)foreachdocument. 5 Results In order to determine the empirical upper and lower bounds of inter-human agreement, we first ran crosshumanevaluationusingunigramco-occurrencescoring through six human summary pairs, i.e. (H1,H2), (H1,H3),(H2,H1),(H2,H3),(H3,H1),and(H3,H2).For a summary pair (X,Y), we used X as the model summaryandYasthesystemsummary.Figure4showsthe distributionsoffourdifferentscenarios.TheMaxHdistribution picks the best inter-human agreement scores foreachdocument,theMinHdistributiontheminimum one,theMedHdistributionthemedian,andthe AvgH distributiontheaverage.Theaverageofthebestinterhuman agreement and the average of average interhumanagreementdifferbyabout10percentinunigram co-occurrencescoreand18percentbetweenMaxHand MinH.

Notable systems are SUMMONS (Radev and McKeown, 1998) and RIPTIDE (White et al. , 2001), which assume perfect extracted information and then perform closed domain summarization. 
In addition, a Figure 1: Hypertext Summary Overview Figure 2: Tables of Death Toll Estimates heuristic-based clustering algorithm organizes the extracted concepts into output templates specifically designed to support multi-document summarization: the IE system, for example, distinguishes different reports or views of the same event from multiple sources (White et al. , 2001). 
Other systems based on information extraction (McKeown et al. , 2002; Radev and McKeown, 1998; White et al. , 2001) and discourse analysis (Marcu, 1999; Strzalkowski et al. , 1999) also exist but they are not yet usable for general-domain summarization. 
We chose to use TDT2 topic 89 so that we could assess the impact of the IE quality on the results, given that we had previously created manual IE annotations for these articles (White et al. , 2001).1 1Although our decision to use subsets of TDT2 topic 89 as inputs meant that our training/tuning and test data overlapped, we do not believe that this choice overly compromises our results, since  as will be discussed in this section and the next  the impact of the IE groups For each input document set, we ran the RIPTIDES system to produce overview summaries of 200 words or less.

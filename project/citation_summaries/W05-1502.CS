The more restricted class of LCFRS has received more attention concerning parsing (Villemonte de la Clergerie, 2002; Burden and Ljunglof, 2005).


Several parsing algorithms for LCFRS or equivalent formalisms are found in the literature; see for instance (Seki et al., 1991; Boullier, 2004; Burden and Ljunglof, 2005).

This choice is justified by previous studies (Moschitti et al. , 2005) showing that for lower nodes, the role classification is generally more accurate than for upper ones; ??if only two nodes are involved, i.e. they dominate each other, then keep the one with the higher SVM classification score.

Such models have already been investigated in (Pradhan et al., 2005; Moschitti et al., 2005). 
With the efforts of many researchers (Carreras and Mrquez 2004, 2005, Moschitti 2004, Pradhan et al 2005, Zhang et al 2007), different machine learning methods and linguistics resources are applied in this task, which has made SRL task progress fast. 
We used the models developed during our participation to the CoNLL 2005 shared task (Moschitti et al. , 2005).

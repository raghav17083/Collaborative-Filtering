EM-HMM tagger provided with good initial conditions (Goldberg et al., 2008) 91.4* (*uses linguistic constraints and manual adjustments to the dictionary) Figure 1: Previous results on unsupervised POS tagging using a dictionary (Merialdo, 1994) on the full 45-tag set. 
4.1 Complete ambiguity classes Ambiguity classes capture the relevant property we are interested in: words with the same category possibilities are grouped together.4 And ambiguity classes have been shown to be successfully employed, in a variety of ways, to improve POS tagging (e.g., Cutting et al., 1992; Daelemans et al., 1996; Dickinson, 2007; Goldberg et al., 2008; Tseng et al., 2005). 
Even for many unsupervised situations, this is available from a lexicon (e.g., Banko and Moore, 2004; Goldberg et al., 2008). 
Due to its popularity for unsupervised POS induction research (e.g., Goldberg et al., 2008; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Toutanova and Johnson, 2008) and its often-used tagset, for our initial research, we use the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), with 36 tags (plus 9 punctuation tags), and we use sections 00-18, leaving held-out data for future experiments.4 Defining frequent frames as those occurring at 4Even if we wanted child-directed speech, the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000) uses coarse POS tags. 
Thus, an orthogonal line of research can involve inducing classes for words which are more general than single categories, i.e., something akin to ambiguity classes (see, e.g., the discussion of ambiguity class guessers in Goldberg et al., 2008).

A similar formulation using dependency trees derived from TreeBank was reported in Hacioglu (Hacioglu, 2004). 
We investigate ways to combine hypotheses generated from semantic role taggers trained using different syntactic views  one trained using the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000), another on a rule-based dependency parser  Minipar (Lin, 1998), and a third based on a flat, shallow syntactic chunk representation (Hacioglu, 2004a). 
al., 2003b; Hacioglu, 2004). 
In our approach, all documents are preprocessed with a syntactic phrase chunker (Hacioglu, 2004) and the EXERT 1 system (Hacioglu et al. 2005; Chen & Hacioglu, 2006), a named-entity detection and co-reference resolution system that was developed for the ACE 2 project. 
To address these errors, we added two additional parse representations: i) Minipar dependency parser, and ii) chunking parser (Hacioglu et al. , 2004).

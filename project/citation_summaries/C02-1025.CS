Global information is known to be useful in other NLP tasks, especially in the named entity recognition task, and several studies successfully used global features (Chieu and Ng, 2002; Finkel et al. , 2005). 
Chieu and Ng (2002) propose a solution to this problem: for each token, they define additional features based on known information, taken from other occurrences of the same token in the document. 
7 Related Work Recent work looking to directly model non-local dependencies and do approximate inference are that of Bunescu and Mooney (2004), who use a Relational Markov Network (RMN) (Taskar et al. , 2002) to explicitly model long-distance dependencies, Sutton and McCallum (2004), who introduce skip-chain CRFs, which add additional non-local edges to the underlying CRF sequence model (which Bunescu and Mooney (2004) lack) and Finkel et al. 
Chieu and Ng (2002) conducted named entity recognition using global features as well as local features. 
(Borthwick, 1999) made a second tagging pass which uses information on token sequences tagged in the first pass; (Chieu and Ng, 2002) used as features information about features assigned to other instances of the same token.

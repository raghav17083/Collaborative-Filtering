Furthermore, even though many frames identify the same category, 1This use of frame is different than that used for subcategorization frames, which are also used to induce word classes (e.g., Korhonen et al., 2003). 
1 Introduction Recent research shows that it is possible, using current natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technology, to automatically induce lexical classes from corpus data with promising accuracy (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Korhonen et al., 2003; Schulte im Walde, 2006; Joanis et al., 2007). 
Clustering methods have also been extensively researched for verb classification (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999; Schulte im Walde, 2000; McCarthy, 2001; Korhonen, 2002; Korhonen et al., 2003; Schulte im Walde, 2003). 
Experiments have been reported using both (i) deep syntactic features (e.g. subcategorization frames (SCFs)) extracted using parsers and subcategorisation acquisition systems (Schulte im Walde, 2000; Korhonen et al., 2003; Schulte im Walde, 2006) and (ii) shallow ones (e.g. NPs/PPs preceding/following verbs) extracted using taggers and chunkers (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Joanis et al., 2007). 
While manual classification of large numbers of words has proved difficult and time-consuming, recent research shows that it is possible to automatically induce lexical classes from corpus data with promising accuracy (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Korhonen et al. , 2003).

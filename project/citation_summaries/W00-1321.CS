The parsing methods using clause-based segmentation have been studied to improve the parsing performance and the parsing complexity (Kim et al. , 2000; Lyon and Dickerson, 1997; Sang and Dejean, 2001).


However, most parsers still tend to show low performance on the long sentences (Li et al. , 1990; Doi et al. , 1993; Kim et al. , 2000).

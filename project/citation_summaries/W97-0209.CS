4.1 Extended Selectional Preferences Selectional preferences generally refer to the phenomenon that, under normal circumstances, some verbs constrain the meanings of other words in a sentence (Manning and Schutze, 1999; Resnik, 1997). 
The learning algorithm requires sample corpora to be constituted by verb-noun, noun-verb, or verb-prepnoun dependencies, where the nouns are semantically tagged by using lexical hierarchies such as WordNet (Resnik, 1997; Framis, 1995). 
We tested our model using the test and training data developed by Resnik (see Resnik, 1997). 
Resnik (1997) described a method to acquire a set of conceptual classes for word senses, employing selectional preferences, based on the idea that certain linguistic predicates constraint the semantic interpretation of underlying words into certain classes. 
Statistical techniques, both supervised learning from tagged corpora (Yarowsky, 1992), (Ng and Lee, 1.996), and unsupervised learning (Yarowsky, 1995), (Resnik, 1997), have been investigated.

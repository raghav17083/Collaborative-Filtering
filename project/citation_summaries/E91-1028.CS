It is also an extension of the Full Brevity algorithm, since it allows for relational descriptions, as does the Dale & Haddock (1991) algorithm. 
Over the last decade, (Dale, 1989, Dale, Haddock, 1991, Reiter, 1990b, Dale, Reiter, 1995), and others 2 have contributed to this issue The term 'referential description' is due to Donellan (Donellan, 1966). 
1 Introduction The generation of referring expressions is one of the most common tasks in natural language generation, and has been addressed by many researchers in the past two decades (including Appelt 1985, Dale 1992, Reiter 1990, Dale & Haddock 1991, Dale & Reiter 1995, Horacek 1997, Stone & Webber 1998, Krahmer & Theune 1999 and van Deemter 2000). 
For that purpose, most past work (Appelt, 1985; Dale and Haddock, 1991; Dale, 1992; Dale and Reiter, 1995; Heeman and Hirst, 1995; Horacek, 1997; Krahmer and Theune, 2002; van Deemter, 2002; Krahmer et al. , 2003) makes use of attributes of an intended object (the target) and binary relations between the target and others (distractors) to distinguish the target from distractors. 
Since hierarchies involve relations, the first algorithm that comes to mind is the one proposed by Dale and Haddock (1991).

This paper will extend upon his discussion, and describe its role in ILEX, a text generation system which delivers descriptions of entities on-line from an underlying knowledgebase (see Mellish et al. 1998). 
However, a semantic relation can only be used if the knowledge assumed to be shared by the hearer is introduced in the previous discourse (Mellish et al 1998a). 
For better coordination, we adopt the text planner based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as described in (Mellish et al. , 1998a). 
(; . Figure 1: Browsing Object Descriptions In this regard, ILEX should be more fruitfully compared with text generation systems such as GOSSIP (Carcagno and Iordanskaja, 1993), PEBA (Milosavljevie, 1997; Milosavljevic, 1999), or POWER (Dale et al. , 1998), systems which build an extended text fl'om an underlying database. 
There are cases, though, in which these techniques may face some limitations, for example, when the structure of the discourse is difficult to anticipate (Mellish et al. 1998).

It is also related to the Markov Random Field methods for parsing suggested in (Johnson et al. 1999), and the boosting methods for parsing in (Collins 2000). 
The Maximum Entropy model (Berger et al., 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Abney, 1997) is a conditional model that assigns a probability to every possible parse  for a given sentence s. The model consists of a set of m feature functions fj() that describe properties of parses, together with their associated weights j. The denominator is a normalization term where Y (s) is the set of parses with yield s: p(|s;) = exp( summationtextm j=1 jfj())summationtext yY (s) exp( summationtextm j=1 jfj(y))) (1) The parameters (weights) j can be estimated efficiently by maximizing the regularized conditional likelihood of a training corpus (Johnson et al., 1999; van Noord and Malouf, 2005):  = argmax  logL()  summationtextm j=1  2j 22 (2) where L() is the likelihood of the training data.

The method is related to the boosting approach to ranking problems (Freund et al. 1998), the Markov Random Field methods of (Johnson et al. 1999), and the boosting approaches for parsing in (Collins 2000).

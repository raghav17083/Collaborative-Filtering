Using these individual operations as features in the classification task directly has been shown to perform well on spelling correction and normalization tasks (e.g., Brill and Moore, 2000; Okazaki et al., 2008b).


In previous work, gen(q) is typically generated by using an edit distance function or using a discriminative model trained for its own purpose (Okazaki et al., 2008b), often in combination with a pre-complied lexicon.


Okazaki et al.s (2008b) method of generating edit operations may not be viable for our purposes, as they assume that the original and candidate strings are very similar in their surface representation  they target only spelling variants and inflection in English.


4 Discriminative Model of Identifying Term Variation Recent work in spelling correction (Ahmed and Kondrak, 2005; Li et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007) and normalization (Okazaki et al., 2008b) formulates the task in a discriminative framework:    = argmax  gen     ( | ) This model consists of two components: gen(q) generates a list of candidates C(q) for an input query q, which are then ranked by the ranking function P(c|q).


Addition of more targeted features for this subclass of term variation (e.g., Okazaki et al., 2008a) is called for, and will be considered in future work.

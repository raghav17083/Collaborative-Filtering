UPV-WSD NUS-PT SSI 78.63 82.50 83.21 Table 3: Results as F1 Values of top performing systems for the SemEval07 Task07 (UPV = (Buscaldi and Rosso, 2007), NUS-PT = (Chan et al., 2007), and SSI = a task organizers system (Navigli and Velardi, 2005)). 
WSD is one of the fundamental problems in natural language processing and is important for applications such as machine translation (MT) (Chan et al., 2007a; Carpuat and Wu, 2007), information retrieval (IR), etc. WSD is typically viewed as a classification problem where each ambiguous word is assigned a sense label (from a pre-defined sense inventory) during the disambiguation process. 
In the English all-words task of the previous SENSEVAL evaluations (SENSEVAL-2, SENSEVAL3, SemEval-2007), the best performing English all-words task systems with the highest WSD accuracy were trained on SEMCOR (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001; Decadt et al., 2004; Chan et al., 2007b). 
For parts-of-speech, we use 7 features: P3, P2, P1, P0, P1, P2, P3, where P0 is the POS of w, and Pi (Pi) is the POS of the ith token to the left (right) of w. For surrounding words, we consider all unigrams (single words) in the surrounding context of w. These words can be in a different sentence from w. For our experiments reported in this paper, we use support vector machines (SVM) as our learning algorithm, which was shown to achieve good WSD performance in (Lee and Ng, 2002; Chan et al., 2007b). 
We note that the best performing system (Chan et al., 2007b) of this task achieved a relatively high accuracy of 82.5%, highlighting the importance of having an appropriate level of sense granularity.

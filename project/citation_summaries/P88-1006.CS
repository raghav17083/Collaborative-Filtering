Comparatives add significant expressive power to an interface (Ballard 1988), and it is therefore important that reliable techniques be developed to resolve the lexical ambiguities that occur in CEs.


Two exceptions are the recent papers of Ballard (1988) and Rayner and Banks (1988).


INTRODUCTION Many treatments of the English comparative construction have been advanced recently in the computational linguistics literature (e.g. Rayner and Banks, 1989; Ballard, 1988).


We will ignore complex comparative operators ("more than twice as much as"; "at least two inches longer than three times as long as"); these are well dealt with in Ballard (1988), and in any case do not seem to pose fundamental difficulties.


So far, there has been a surprisingly small amount of work done in computational frameworks: the only major attempts known to us that integrate syntactic and semantic processing are those reported in Ballard (1988) and Friedmann (1989).

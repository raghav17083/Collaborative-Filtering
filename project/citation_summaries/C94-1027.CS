11We use the Tree Tagger (Schmid, 1994) for all POS tagging except for Arabic, where we use the tagger described in Diab et al. 
In the data-driven approach, the model is automatically generated from annotated text corpora, and the model can be represented e.g. as n-grams (Garside et al. , 1987), local rules (Hindle, 1989) or neural nets (Schmid, 1994). 
A statistical-based suffix learner is presented in Schmid (1994). 
3.1 Part of Speech Tags We use TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) to produce POS tags and then open class words are restricted if the POS tagger assigned a tag with a probability over a certain threshold. 
In order to proceed with POS-tagging, such various methods as Hidden Markov Models (HMM); Memorybased models (Daelemans, 1996); Transformationbased Learning (TBL) (Brill, 1995); Maximum Entropy; decision trees (Schmid, 1994a); Neural network (Schmid, 1994b); and so on can be used.

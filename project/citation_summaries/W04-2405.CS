Till now, co-training has been successfully applied to statistical parsing (Sarkar, 2001), reference resolution (Ng and Cardie, 2003), part of speech tagging (Clark et al., 2003), word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea, 2004) and email classification (Kiritchenko and Matwin, 2001). 
Many corpus based statistical methods have been proposed to solve this problem, including supervised learning algorithms (Leacock et al. , 1998; Towel and Voorheest, 1998), weakly supervised learning algorithms (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Li and Li, 2004; Mihalcea, 2004; Niu et al. , 2005; Park et al. , 2000; Yarowsky, 1995), unsupervised learning algorithms (or word sense discrimination) (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997; Schutze, 1998), and knowledge based algorithms (Lesk, 1986; McCarthy et al. , 2004). 
Co-training has been applied to a number of NLP applications, including POS-tagging (Clark et al. , 2003), parsing (Sarkar, 2001), word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea, 2004), and base noun phrase detection (Pierce and Cardie, 2001). 
3.2 Comparison between SVM, Bootstrapping and LP For WSD, SVM is one of the state of the art supervised learning algorithms (Mihalcea et al. , 2004), while bootstrapping is one of the state of the art semi-supervised learning algorithms (Li and Li, 2004; Yarowsky, 1995). 
They roughly fall into three categories according to what is used for supervision in learning process: (1) using external resources, e.g., thesaurus or lexicons, to disambiguate word senses or automatically generate sense-tagged corpus, (Lesk, 1986; Lin, 1997; McCarthy et al. , 2004; Seo et al. , 2004; Yarowsky, 1992), (2) exploiting the differences between mapping of words to senses in different languages by the use of bilingual corpora (e.g. parallel corpora or untagged monolingual corpora in two languages) (Brown et al. , 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994; Diab and Resnik, 2002; Li and Li, 2004; Ng et al. , 2003), (3) bootstrapping sensetagged seed examples to overcome the bottleneck of acquisition of large sense-tagged data (Hearst, 1991; Karov and Edelman, 1998; Mihalcea, 2004; Park et al. , 2000; Yarowsky, 1995).

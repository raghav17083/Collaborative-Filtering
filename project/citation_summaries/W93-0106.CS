Thus, some research has been focused on deriving different word-sense groupings to overcome the finegrained distinctions of WN (Hearst and Schutze, 1993), (Peters et al., 1998), (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001), (Agirre and LopezDeLaCalle, 2003), (Navigli, 2006) and (Snow et al., 2007). 
Another way to prepare a representation of a word class is what may be called the centroidbased approach (e.g. , Pereira et al. 1993). 
(1993) found that direct annotation takes twice as long as automatic tagging plus correction, for partof-speech annotation); and the output quality reflects the difficulty of the task (inter-annotator disagreement is on the order of 10%, as contrasted with the approximately 3% error rate reported for part-of-speech annotation by Marcus et al.). 
SemCor (Miller et al., 1993) is a subset of the Brown Corpus plus the novel The Red Badge of Courage, and it has been developed by the same group that created WordNet. 
Its previous applications (e.g. , Grefenstette 1993, Hearst and Schuetze 1993, Takunaga et al 1997, Lin 1998, Caraballo 1999) demonstrated that cooccurrence statistics on a target word is often sufficient for its automatical classification into one of numerous classes such as synsets of WordNet.

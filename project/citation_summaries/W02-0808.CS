More specifically, the sense inventory used is MultiWordNet (Pianta et al. , 2002), a multilingual lexical database in which the Italian component is strictly aligned with the English WordNet. 
The research of (Chugur et al. , 2002) dealt with sense distinctions across multiple languages. 
In subsequent work (Ide et al. , 2002), seven languages and clustering techniques are employed to create sense groups based on the translations. 
We described in (Ide et al. 2002) how this program is used in word clustering and in checking out the validity of the cross-lingual links between the monolingual wordnets of the multilingual Balkanet lexical ontology (Stamatou et al. 2002). 
Factors that have been proposed as affecting human or system sense disambiguation include whether annotators are allowed to assign multilabels (Veronis, 1998; Ide et al., 2002; Passonneau et al., 2006), the number or granularity of senses (Ng et al., 1999), merging of related senses (Snow et al., 2007), sense similarity (Chugur et al., 2002), sense perplexity (Diab, 2004), entropy (Diab, 2004; Palmer et al., 2005), and in psycholinguistic experiments, reactions times required to distinguish senses (Klein and Murphy, 2002; Ide and Wilks, 2006).

Resnik and Smith (2003) use a similar idea of candidates and filters in their STRAND system. 
Based on such observations, some web mining systems have been developed to automatically obtain parallel corpora from the web (Nie et al 1999; Ma and Liberman 1999; Chen, Chau and Yeh 2004; Resnik and Smith 2003a0 Zhang et al 2006 ). 
Whether this is true for comparable corpora from other domains is an empirical question outside the scope of this article; however, both our results and those of Resnik and Smith (2003) strongly indicate that good data is available on the Web. 
Resnik and Smith (2003) propose their STRAND web-mining based system and show that their approach is able to find large numbers of similar document pairs. 
Most existing methods of mining bilingual sentences from the Web, such as (Nie et al., 1999; Resnik and Smith, 2003; Shi et al., 2006), mine parallel web documents within bilingual web sites first and then extract bilingual sentences from mined parallel documents using sentence alignment methods.

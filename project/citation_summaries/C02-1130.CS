Fleischman and Hovy (2002) approached the ontology population problem as a classification task, providing examples of instances in their context as training examples for their respective fine-grained categories. 
Weakly supervised learning methods for semantic lexicon generation have utilized co-occurrence statistics (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Roark and Charniak, 1998), syntactic information (Tanev and Magnini, 2006; Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004; Phillips and Riloff, 2002), lexico-syntactic contextual patterns (e.g., resides in <location> or moved to <location>) (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002), and local and global contexts (Fleischman and Hovy, 2002). 
(1997), Fleischman and Hovy (2002), and Florian et al. 
3.2 Semantic Kernels It has been shown that semantic information is fundamental for improving the accuracy and reducing the amount of training data in many natural language tasks, including fine-grained classification of named entities (Fleischman and Hovy, 2002), question classification (Li and Roth, 2005), text categorization (Giozzo and Strapparava, 2005), word sense disambiguation (Gliozzo et al., 2005). 
For fine-grainedpersonNE categorization, (Fleischman and Hovy, 2002) carried out a supervised learning for which they deduced features from the local context in which the entity resides, as well as semantic information derived from the topic signatures and WordNet.

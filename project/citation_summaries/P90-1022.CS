Following Kaplan and Bresnan (1982), Pereira and Shieber (1984), Kasper and Rounds (1986, 1990), and Johnson (1988, 1990a) the constraints that determine the feature structures are regarded as formulae from a language for describing feature structures, rather than as feature structures themselves. 
Johnson and Klein (1986) and Johnson and Kay (1990) show how "set-valued" features can be used to express Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp 1981) in a complex-feature based grammar formalism. 
This paper follows an alternative strategy suggested in Johnson (1990a): axiomatize the relevant properties of feature structures in some well-understood language (here first-order logic) and translate constraints on these structures into the same language. 
4 It is possible to avoid these problems by augmenting feature structures with "inequality arcs," as was first proposed (to my knowledge) by Karttunen (1984) and discussed in Johnson (1990a), Johnson (in press) and pages 67-72 of Johnson (1988). 
Instead of providing entities in the interpretation that serve as the denotation for "disjunctive" or "negative" features, we follow Kasper and Rounds (1986, 1990), Moshier and Rounds (1987), and Johnson (1988, 1990) in permitting disjunction and negation only in the constraint language.

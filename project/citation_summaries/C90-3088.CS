Li's method (Li et al. , 1990) for sentence segmentation also depends upon manualintensive pattern rules.


Pattern rules (Li et al. , 1990) and sentence patterns (Kim and Khn, 1995) were used to segment long English sentences.


However, most parsers still tend to show low performance on the long sentences (Li et al. , 1990; Doi et al. , 1993; Kim et al. , 2000).

TEXTRACT is populated by a number of plugins, providing functionalities for:  tokenization;  document structure analysis, from tags and white space;  lexicon interface, complete with efficient lookup and full morphology;  importation of lexical and vocabulary analyses from a non-TEXTRACT process via XML markup;  analysis of out-of-vocabulary words (Park, 2002);  abbreviation finding and expansion (Park and Byrd, 2001);  named entity identification and classification (person names, organizations, places, and so forth) (Ravin and Wacholder, 1997);  technical term identification, in technical prose (Justeson and Katz, 1995);  vocabulary determination and glossary extraction, in specialized domains (Park et al. , 2002);  vocabulary aggregation, with reduction to canonical form, within and across documents;  part-of-speech tagging (with different taggers) for determining syntactic categories in context;  shallow syntactic parsing, for identifying phrasal and clausal constructs and semantic relations (Boguraev, 2000);  salience calculations, both of interand intradocument salience;  analysis of topic shifts within a document (Boguraev and Neff, 2000a);  document clustering, cluster organization, and cluster labeling;  single document summarization, configurable to deploy different algorithmic schemes (sentence extraction, topical highlights, lexical cohesion) (Boguraev and Neff, 2000a, 2000b);  multi-document summarization, using iterative residual rescaling (Ando et al. , 2000);  pattern matching, deploying finite state technology specially designed to operate over document content abstractions (as opposed to a character stream alone).


A number of applications utilizing TFST include a shallow parser (Boguraev, 2000), a front end to a glossary identification tool (Park et al. , 2002), a parser for temporal expressions, a named entity recognition device, and a tool for extracting hypernym relations.

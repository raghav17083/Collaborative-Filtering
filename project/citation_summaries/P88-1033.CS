4The idea of implementing categorial grammar as a non-directional logic, but associating atomic types with string position pairs (i.e. spans) to handle word order, is used in Pareschi (1988), although in that approach all string positions instantiate to values on a single ordering (i.e. integers 0 n for a string of length n), which is not sufficient for Lambek calculus deductions.

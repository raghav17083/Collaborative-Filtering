However, it takes a cautious approach in that it only adopts those referential relations from MATE for which the developers of MATE report a sufficiently high level of interannotator agreement (Poesio et al. , 1999). 
Researchers at Essex were responsible for the coreference markup scheme developed in MATE (Poesio et al, 1999; Poesio, 2004a) and have annotated corpora using this scheme including a subset of the Penn Treebank (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), and the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2004a). 
1 Introduction The MATE meta-scheme for anaphora annotation (Poesio et al. , 1999) is one of the annotation schemes developed as part of the MATE project (McKelvie et al. , 2001), whose goal was to develop annotation tools suitable for different types of dialogue annotation. 
Researchers at Essex (UK) were responsible for the coreference markup scheme developed in MATE (Poesio et al, 1999; Poesio, 2004a), partially implemented in the annotation tool MMAX and now proposed as an ISO standard; and have been responsible for the creation of two small, but commonly used anaphorically annotated corpora  the Vieira / Poesio subset of the Penn Treebank (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), and the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2004a). 
For this study we simply developed a coding manual for the purposes of our experiment, broadly based on the approach adopted in MATE (Poesio et al. , 1999) and GNOME (Poesio, 2004), but introducing new types of annotation (ambiguous anaphora, and a simple form of discourse deixis) while simplifying other aspects (e.g. , by not annotating bridging references).

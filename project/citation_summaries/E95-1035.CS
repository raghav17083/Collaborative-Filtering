A wealth of prior research by (Passoneau 1988), (Webber 1988), (Hwang and Schubert 1992), (Kamp and Reyle 1993), (Lascarides and Asher 1993), (Hitzeman et al. 1995), (Kehler 2000) and others, has explored the different knowledge sources used in inferring the temporal ordering of events, including temporal adverbials, tense, aspect, rhetorical relations, pragmatic conventions, and background knowledge. 
Second, temporal discourse markers can even overwrite the temporal relations indicated by other linguistic means like tense and aspect, as noted by researchers who work in the analysis of temporal markers (e.g. Hitzeman et al. 1995). 
Although there has been much work on extracting and inferring such information from texts (Hitzeman et al. , 1995; Mani and Wilson, 2000; Filatova and Hovy, 2001; Boguraev and Ando, 2005), none of this work has exploited the implicit event duration information from the text.

There exists a large body of research in NLU on analysing the temporal structure of texts, including the role of temporal markers, though again restricted to English (Moens and Steedman 1988; Lascarides and Oberlander 1993; Hitzeman et al. 1995).

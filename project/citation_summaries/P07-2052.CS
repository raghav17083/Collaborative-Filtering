However, the model analysis in (McDonald, 2006) reveals that bilexical features hardly contribute to the performance of a discriminative MSTbased dependency parser, while Kawahara and Uchimoto (2007) demonstrate that minimallylexicalized shift-reduce based dependency parsers can produce near state-of-the-art accuracy.

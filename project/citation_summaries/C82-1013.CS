interface The interface ~s realized with Macromed\]a D~rector CommumcaUon between CLOS and Macromecha Director Is medmted by Apple Events 1 Introduction The SlmSum (Slmulatmn of Summarizing) system does what its name pronuses It simulates summanzang of human experts and thus produces a computaUonal cogmUve model of their processing The model concentrates on the specific features of summanzmg It presupposes "normal" text understan&ng and text producUon The slmulaUon serves scientific and presentational purposes  As usual, the computer model serves to explain and check the empirical cogmtlve model winch ~s Rs foundation  It prepares a cogmtlvely grounded approach to automatic summarnzmg, something hke agents runmng through the net and m response to a user's query, bnngmg home a reasonably short statement (a summary) of the knowledge avmlable  To its users of today, SlmSum shows m a movle-hke style how expert summanzers perform real-world workJng processes, thus complementing a textbook about summanzmg The advantage of the simulation ressembles that of a flight simulator As pflotes steer through possibly difficult situations ~n the physical world, summarizers work their way through a flood of mforrnatlon Both activities are cogmt~vely demanchng People understand them better if they are presented wRh them m reahsuc setungs S~mulatmn approaches to summarizing are few and far between, but one can point to the SUSY system (Fum et al, 1982, 1984 and 1985) as an ancestor of S~mSum SUSY aimed at following human performance m a hn~ted way, though keeping at a distance from real s~mulauon S~mSum represents progress wnh respect to SUSY, because ~t ts empmcally founded, ~t does a real slmulauon, and ~t ~s implemented Furthermore, S~mSum renovates through ~ts mulUmed~a user interface For practical reasons, the SlmSum simulation ts restricted to 20 working steps involving 79 agents They were chosen from an empmcal cogmUve model (a "grounded theory" Glaser & Strauss, 1980, see also Lincoln & Guba, 1985, for the way to lmplementatton refer to Schrelber et al 1993) of summarizing wlnch comprises an intellectual toolbox of 552 strategies,, knowledge about the process organization and a set of interpreted.

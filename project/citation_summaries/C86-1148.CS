The recognized necessity to describe the concept lexicon prior to dealing with natural languages is a feature which clearly distinguishes our approach from Computational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1987 277 Sergei Nirenburg and Victor Raskin The Subworld Concept Lexicon and the Lexicon Management System other work on lexical aids (e.g. , Ahlswede 1985) and brings us closer to some non-NL work on knowledge acquisition (e.g. , Lenat et al. 1986). 
A more thorough introduction to TRANSI.ATOR can be found th TUCKER AND NIRENBURG (1984) and NIRENBURG ET AL (1986). 
The work in lexicon has centered on a) studies concerned with the utilization of conventional humanoriented dictionaries, newly available in machine-readable form, for computational tasks (e.g. , Amsler 1984a,b; Chodorow et al. 1985; Ahlswede 1985; Markowitz et al. 1986) improving the ancillary capabilities for lexicon systems, such as, for instance, morphological processors and descriptions (e.g. , Nirenburg and Ben Asher 1984; Byrd et al. 1986; Boguraev et al. 1987); c) hand-building of lexicons necessary for natural language systems, often with considerations about extensibility (e.g. , Zernik and Dyer 1985; Bessemer and Jacobs 1987). 
An application of this work in designin~g the M-based machine translation nmdel, TRANSLATOR, is discussed in NIRENBURG ET AL (1986) which appears elsewhere in this volume. 
In the area of machine translation the analysis and generation lexicons involve two different natural languages, which creates the task of building such resources as, say, an Englishsubworld and subworld -Russian lexicons, as is the case, for example, in TRANSLATOR, the knowledge-based machine translation project for the computer subworld (see Nirenburg et al. 1985, 1986, 1987).

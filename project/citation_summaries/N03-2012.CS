When only lexical features are used (the rst three entries), the SVMbased contrast classi er using meta-classi ers gives the best performance, outperforming the decision tree in (Hillard et al. , 2003) and the maximum enTable 1: Comparison of 3-way classi cation accuracy on lexical (lex) vs. expanded (exp) features sets. 
Previously researchers have focused on the interactive aspects of argumentative and decisionmaking dialogue, tackling issues such as the detection of agreement and disagreement and the level of emotional involvement of conversational participants (Hillard et al., 2003; Wrede and Shriberg, 2003; Galley et al., 2004; Gatica-Perez et al., 2005).

3.2 Results First, we performed the same experiment as in (Hillard et al. , 2003) and (Galley et al. , 2004), using the contrast classi er (CC) method . Among the four meetings, the data from one meeting was set aside for testing. 
This recent research has tackled issues such as the automatic detection of agreement and disagreement (Hillard et al., 2003; Galley et al., 2004), and of the level of involvement of conversational participants (Wrede and Shriberg, 2003; Gatica-Perez et al., 2005).

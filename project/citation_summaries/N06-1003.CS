3.3 Source language paraphrases In order to deal with the sparsity associated with a rich source language morphology and limitedsize parallel corpora (bitexts), we experimented with a novel approach to paraphrasing out-ofvocabulary (OOV) source language phrases in our Hungarian-English system, using monolingual contextual similarity rather than phrase-table pivoting (Callison-Burch et al., 2006) or monolingual bitexts (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Dolan et al., 2004). 
Recent work has shown how paraphrases can improve question answering through query expansion (Riezler et al., 2007), automatic evaluation of translation and summarization by modeling alternative lexicalization (Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006; Zhou et al., 2006; Owczarzak et al., 2006), and machine translation both by dealing with out of vocabulary words and phrases (Callison-Burch et al., 2006) and by expanding the set of reference translations for minimum error rate training (Madnani et al., 2007). 
2.2 Paraphrasing in MT A recent strategy to broadly deal with the problem of unknown terms is to paraphrase the source text with terms whose translation is known to the system, using paraphrases learnt from multilingual corpora, typically involving at least one pivot language different from the target language of immediate interest (Callison-Burch et 792 al., 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Zhao et al., 2008; Callison-Burch, 2008; Guzman and Garrido, 2008). 
Paraphrase generation has already proven to be valuable for Question Answering (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Riezler et al., 2007), Machine Translation (Callison-Burch et al., 2006) and the evaluation thereof (Russo-Lassner et al., 2006; Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006; Zhou et al., 2006), but also for text simplification and explanation. 
The table augmentation idea is similar to CallisonBurch et al.s (Callison-Burch et al., 2006), but our proposed paradigm does not require using a limited resource such as parallel texts in order to generate paraphrases.

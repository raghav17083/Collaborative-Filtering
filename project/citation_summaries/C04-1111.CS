Useful semantic relations can be extracted from large corpora using relatively simple patterns (e.g. , (Pantel et al. , 2004)). 
Patterns have been shown to produce more accurate results than feature vectors, at a lower computational cost on large corpora (Pantel et al., 2004). 
2.1 Relationship Types There is a large body of related work that deals with discovery of basic relationship types represented in useful resources such as WordNet, including hypernymy (Hearst, 1992; Pantel et al., 2004; Snow et al., 2006), synonymy (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006; Widdows and Dorow, 2002) and meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Girju et al., 2006). 
Due to the need for POS tagging and/or parsing, these types of methods have been evaluated only on fixed corpora1, although (Pantel et al., 2004) demonstrated how to scale up their algorithms for the Web. 
Since (Hearst, 1992), who used a manually prepared set of initial lexical patterns in order to acquire relationships, numerous pattern-based methods have been proposed for the discovery of concepts from seeds (Pantel et al., 2004; Davidov et al., 2007; Pasca et al., 2006).

Although knowledge-bases of entailment-rules and paraphrases learned by acquisition algorithms were used in other NLP applications, such as QA (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) and IE (Sudo et al. , 2003; Romano et al. , 2006), to the best of our knowledge the output of such algorithms was never applied to IR before. 
Up to now, the most successful approaches have used fairly impoverished semantic representations, relying on measures of lexical or semantic overlap (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005), pattern-based relation extraction (Romano et al. , 2006), or approximate matching of predicate-argument structure (Hickl et al. , 2006). 
One approach which was used for evaluating automatically acquired rules is to measure their contribution to the performance of specific systems, such as QA (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) or IE (Sudo et al. , 2003; Romano et al. , 2006). 
Up to now, the most successful approaches have used fairly shallow semantic representations, relying on measures of lexical or semantic overlap (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005), pattern-based relation extraction (Romano et al., 2006), or approximate matching of predicate-argument structure (Hickl et al., 2006). 
Several important applications are already relying heavily on inference, including question answering (Moldovan et al. 2003; Harabagiu and Hickl 2006), information extraction (Romano et al. 2006), and textual entailment (Szpektor et al. 2004).

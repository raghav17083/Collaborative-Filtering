In the work of Moore (2004a) and Melamed (2000), two words cooccur if they are present in a pair of aligned sentences in the parallel training corpus. 
Apart from mining term translations directly from bilingual web pages, more approaches have been proposed to mine term translations from text snippets returned by a web search engine (Jiang et al., 2007; Zhang and Vines, 2004; Cheng et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2005). 
The other is multilingual parallel and comparable corpora (e.g., Wikipedia1), wherein features such as cooccurrence frequency and context are popularly employed (Cheng et al., 2004; Shao and Ng, 2004; Cao et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2008). 
2.2 Using Log-Likelihood-Ratios to Estimate Word Translation Probabilities Our method for computing the probabilistic translation lexicon LLR-Lex is based on the the Log2http://www.fjoch.com/GIZA++.html Likelihood-Ratio (LLR) statistic (Dunning, 1993), which has also been used by Moore (2004a; 2004b) and Melamed (2000) as a measure of word association. 
Moreover, based on the assumption that anchor texts in different languages referring to the same web page are possibly translations of each other, (Lu et al., 2004) propose a novel approach to construct a multilingual lexicon by making use of web anchor texts and their linking structure.

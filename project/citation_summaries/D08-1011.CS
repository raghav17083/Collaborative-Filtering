In both experiments, we used four systems, as listed in Table 2,  they are phrase-based system Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), hierarchical phrasebased system (Chiang, 2007), BTG-based lexicalized reordering phrase-based system (Xiong et al., 2006) and a tree sequence alignment-based tree-to-tree translation system (Zhang et al., 2008). 
Sentence-level combination methods directly select hypotheses from original outputs of single SMT systems (Sim et al., 2007; Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008), while phrase-level or wordlevel combination methods are more complicated and could produce new translations different from any translations in the input (Bangalore et al., 2001; Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Matusov et al., 2006; Sim et al., 2007).

2.2 IHMM-based Alignment Method Since the candidate hypotheses are aligned using Indirect-HMM-based (IHMM-based) alignment method (He et al., 2008) in both direction, we briefly review the IHMM-based alignment method first. 
While (Eisele et al., 2008) included translations from all of a fixed number of RBMT systems and added one feature to the translation model for each system, integrating all given system outputs in this way in our case could expand the search space tremendously.

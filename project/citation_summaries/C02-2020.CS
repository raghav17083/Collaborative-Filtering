For SWTs, combining a general bilingual dictionary with a specialized bilingual dictionary or a multilingual thesaurus to translate context vectors ensures that much of their elements will be translated (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; Dejean et al., 2002). 
For lexical alignment from comparable corpora, good results on single words can be obtained from large corpora  several millions words  the accuracy of proposed translation is about 80% for the top 10-20 candidates (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002). 
The term comparable is used to indicate that these texts share some characteristics or features: topic, period, media, author, register (Biber, 1994), discourse This corpus comparability is discussed by lexical alignment researchers but never demonstrated: it is often reduced to a specific domain, such as the medical (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002) or financial domains (Fung, 1998), or to a register, such as newspaper articles (Fung, 1998). 
After that, researchers extended context heterogeneity vector to context vector with the aid of an existing bilingual dictionary (Fung, 2000; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; Robitaille et al., 2006; Morin et al., 2007; Daille and Morin, 2008). 
For single-item French-English words applied on a medical corpus of 0.66 million words, (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002) obtained 61% and 94% precision on the top-10 and top-20 candidates.

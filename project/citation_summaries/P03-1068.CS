Other ongoing projects, i.e., the German FrameNet or SALSA (Erk et al. , 2003), the Spanish FrameNet (Subirats and Petruck, 2003), and the Japanese FrameNet (Ohara et al. , 2003), are trying to build lexical resources that are compatible with the BFN, but for Japanese at least, no data has been released in a usable form, except for a few annotation examples for verbs of motion. 
2 Corpus and Grammar Resources Frame Semantic Corpus Annotations The basis for our work is a corpus of manual frame annotations, the SALSA/TIGER corpus (Erk et al. , 2003).2 The annotation follows the FrameNet definitions of frames and their semantic roles.3 Underlying this corpus is a syntactically annotated corpus of German newspaper text, the TIGER treebank (Brants et al. , 2002). 
To support this claim, we validated the assoc-classes against standard approaches to semantic verb classes, i.e. GermaNet as the German WordNet (Kunze, 2000), and the German counterpart of FrameNet in the Salsa project (Erk et al. , 2003). 
The basis for our work are annotations of the SALSA/TIGER corpus (Erk et al. , 2003), encoded in an XML annotation scheme that extends the syntactic TIGER XML annotation scheme. 
665 situation holds in other languages (Erk et al., 2003).

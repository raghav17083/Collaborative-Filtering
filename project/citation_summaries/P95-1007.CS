Nounnoun compounds in computational linguistics The automatic interpretation of nominal phrases and compounds is a difcult task for both unsupervised and supervised approaches.Currently, the best-performing nounnoun interpretation methods in computational linguistics focus mostly on two or three-word nounnoun compounds and rely either on ad hoc, domain-specic, hand-coded semantic taxonomies, or statistical models on large collections of unlabeled data.Recent results have shown that symbolic nounnoun compound interpretation systems using machine learning techniques coupled with a large lexical hierarchy perform with very good accuracy, but they are most of the time tailored to a specic domain (Rosario and Hearst 2001; Rosario, Hearst, and Fillmore 2002), or are general purpose (Turney 2006) but rely on semantic similarity metrics on WordNet (Fellbaum 1998).On the other hand, the majority of corpus statistics approaches to nounnoun compound interpretation collect statistics on the occurrence frequency of the noun constituents and use them in a probabilistic model (Lauer 1995).The problem is that most nounnoun compounds are rare and thus, statistics on such infrequent instances lead in general to unreliable estimates of probabilities.More recently, Lapata and Keller (2005) showed that simple unsupervised models applied to the nounnoun compound interpretation task perform signicantly better when the n-gram frequencies are obtained from the Web (55.71% accuracy 4 ), rather than from a large standard corpus. 
Lauer (1995) compared a dependency model with adjacency models, and found that the dependency model is better.

A simple model of compound noun paraphrasing is shown in (6): p = argmaxp P(pjn1;n2)(6) Lauer (1995) points out that the above model contains one parameter for every triple hp;n1;n2i, and as a result Model Altavista BNC f (n1; p) f (p;n2) 50.71 27.85# f (n1; p;n2) 55.71#* 11.42 f (n1; p) f (p;n2)= f (p) 47.14 26.42 f (n1; p;n2)= f (p) 55.00 10.71 Table 10: Performance of Altavista counts and BNC counts for compound interpretation (data from Lauer 1995) Model Accuracy Best BNC 27.856  Lauer (1995): concept-based 28.00 Baseline 33.00 Lauer (1995): word-based 40.00 Best Altavista 55.71 Table 11: Performance comparison with the literature for compound interpretation hundreds of millions of training instances would be necessary. 
We also present empirical observations on the distribution of the syntax and meaning of noun phrases on two different corpora based on two state-of-the-art classification tag sets: Lauers set of 8 prepositions (Lauer, 1995) and our list of 22 semantic relations.

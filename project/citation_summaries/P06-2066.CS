In related work, Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) evaluate a number of constraints that have been proposed to restrict the class of dependency structures characterizing natural language with respect to two dependency treebanks: the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) (Haji et al. , 2001) and the Danish Dependency Treebank (DDT) (Kromann, 2003). 
This measure was introduced by Nivre (2006); Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) call it edge degree. 
Unlike acyclicity and the single head constraints, which impose restrictions on the dependency relation as such, projectivity constrains the interaction between the dependency relations and the order of the nodes in the sentence (Kuhlmann and Nivre, 2006) Graph properties like planarity, gap degree, edge degree and well-nestedness have been proposed in the literature to constrain grammar formalisms and parsing algorithms from looking at unrestricted non-projectivity. 
If we suppose that the characterization of dependency structures as reported by Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) for Czech and Danish extends cross-linguistically, i.e. the dependency structures for natural language falls within the class of well-nested and gap degree ??1 dependency structures, then MC-TAG appears to correspond to the wrong class of modeltheoretic dependency structures. 
In this paper, we consider all constraints and measures evaluated by Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) with some minor variations, cf.

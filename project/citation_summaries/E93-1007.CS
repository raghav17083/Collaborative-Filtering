Recently, a machine learning approach for sequential data has been proposed by Van den Bosch and Daelemans (2005) that is suited for discrete machine-learning algorithms such as memory-based learners, which have been shown to perform well on word phonemization and morphological analysis before (Van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1993; Van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1999). 
One recent study claimed that introduction of linguistic knowledge degrades performance in grapheme-phoneme conversion (van den Bosch and Daelemans 1993). 
Examples include the use of decision trees for syntactic analysis (Magerman, 1995), coreference (Aone and Bennett, 1995; McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995), and cue phrase identification (Litman, 1994); the use of inductive logic programming for learning semantic grammars and building prolog parsers 113 (Zelle and Mooney, 1994; Zelle and Mooney, 1993); the use of conceptual clustering algorithms for relative pronoun resolution (Cardie, 1992a; Cardie 1992b), and the use of case-based learning techniques for lexical tagging tasks (Cardie, 1993a; Daelemans et al. , submitted). 
Different learning algorithms can be used, including Artificial neural networks (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987; Miller, 1998), decision tree learners (Black et al. , 1998), memory-based learners and hybrid symbolic approaches (Van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1993; Daelemans and van den Bosch, 1997), or Markov models. 
Memory-based learning has fruitfully been applied to natural language processing, yielding state-of-theart performance on all levels of linguistic analysis, including grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1993), PoStagging (Daelemans et al. , 1996), and shallow parsing (Cardie et al. , 1999).

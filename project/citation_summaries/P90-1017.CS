628 Bonnie J. Dorr Machine Translation Divergences of generation based on theories of tense by Allen (1983, 1984), Hornstein (1990), and Reichenbach (1947) is discussed in Dorr and Gaasterland (1992) and Dorr (1993b). 
Figure 2 shows the overall design of the UNITRAN machine translation system (Dorr, 1990a, 1990b). 
Consider the following example: (1) (i) I stabbed Jnhn (ii) Yo le di pufialadas a Juan 'I gave knife-wounds to John' This example illustrates a type of distiuctiou (henceforth called divergence as presented in Dorr (1990a)) that arises in machine translation: the sourcelanguage predicate, stab, is,napped to more than one target-language word, dar puiialadas a. This divergence type is lezical in that there is a word selection variation between the source language and the target language. 
A detailed description of the lexical conccplual structure (LCS) which serves as the interlingua is not given here, but see Dorr (1990b) for further discussion, s 81n general, the LCS representation follows the format proposed by Jackeudoff (1983, 1990) which views semautic representation as a subset of conceptual structure. 
Classification of Machine Translation Divergences The divergence problem in machine translation has received increasingly greater attention in recent literature (see, for example, Barnett et al. 1991a, 1991b; Beaven 1992a, 1992b; Dorr 1990a, 1990b; Kameyama et al. 1991; Kinoshita, Phillips, and Tsujii 1992; Lindop and Tsujii 1991; Tsujii and Fujita 1991; Whitelock 1992; related discussion can also be found in work by Melby \[1986\] and Nirenburg and Nirenburg \[1988\]).

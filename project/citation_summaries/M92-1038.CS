The system under evaluation here is based on language processing components that have demonstrated strong performance capabilities in previous evaluations \[Lehnert et al. 1992a\]. 
4.2 Extraction Pattern Learning For our feasibility study, we chose to follow the AutoSlog (Lehnert et al. , 1992; Riloff, 1993) approach to extraction pattern acquisition. 
The system under evaluation here is based on language processing components that have demonstrated strong performance capabilities in previous evaluation s [Lehnert et al . 1992a] . Having demonstrated the general viability of these techniques, we are no w concentrating on the practicality of our technology by creating trainable system components to replac e hand-coded data and manually-engineered software. 
In the UMass/MUC-4 information extraction system (Lehnert et al. , 1992), the words ammunition and bullets were defined as weapons, mainly for the purpose of selectional restrictions. 
We know from our earlier work in the domain of terrorism that coreference resolution can be reasonably well-managed on the basis of hand-coded heuristics \[Lehnert et al. 1992b\].

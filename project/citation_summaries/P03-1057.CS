For instance, example-based MT can be improved by applying an optimization algorithm that uses an automatic evaluation of MT quality (Imamura et al. , 2003).


Figure 1 shows the differences among the performances, indicated by the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve (Section 4.1), of the existing RSCM on each of three MT systems (Section 4.2.1): D3, HPAT, and SAT (Doi and Sumita, 2003; Imamura et al. , 2003; Watanabe et al. , 2003).


HPAT (Hierarchical Phrase Alignment based Translation) is a pattern-based system using automatically generated syntactic transfer (Imamura et al. , 2003).

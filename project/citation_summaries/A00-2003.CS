Some statistical NLG research has looked at subproblems of language generation, such as ordering of NP premodifiers [Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou, 1999; Malouf, 2000], attribute selection in content planning [Oh and Rudnicky, 2000], NP type determination [Poesio et al. , 1999], pronominalisation [Strube and Wolters, 2000], and lexical choice [Bangalore and Rambow, 2000a].

These measures have been used to guide search in wordor phrase-based MT systems (Wang and Waibel, 1997; Och et al. , 2001), but in such models optimal search is generally not practical even with good heuristics. 
Och et al. [1999]s alignment template model can be reframed as a phrase translation system; Yamada and Knight [2001] use phrase translation in a syntaxbased translation system; Marcu and Wong [2002] introduced a joint-probability model for phrase translation; and the CMU and IBM word-based statistical machine translation systems1 are augmented with phrase translation capability. 
We recombine search hypotheses as done by Och et al. [2001]. 
All these works follow two main different approaches according to the number of stacks used in the design and implementation of the search algorithm (the stacks are used to store partial hypotheses, sorted according to their partial score/probability, during the search process) :  On the one hand, in (Wang and Waibel, 1998; Och et al. , 2001) a single stack is used. 
On the other hand, models that deal with structures or phrases instead of single words have also been proposed: the syntax translation models are described in (Yamada and Knight, 2001), alignment templates are used in (Och, 2002), and the alignment template approach is re-framed into the so-called phrase based translation (PBT) in (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Zens et al. , 2002; Koehn et al. , 2003; Tomas and Casacuberta, 2003).

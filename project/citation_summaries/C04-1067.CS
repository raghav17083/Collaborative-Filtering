97 Consequently, we propose a hybrid model of datadriven methods and lexicon-based methods, and show its advantages over both models, in a way that is reminiscent of Nakagawa's (2004) results for Chinese and Japanese. 
It was reported that the original combined method of word-based and character-based processing had high overall accuracy (F-measures) in Chinese word segmentation, compared with the state-of-the-art methods (Nakagawa, 2004). 
It is good at unknown word identification, but only using character-level features sometimes makes mistakes when identifying known words (T.Nakagawa, 2004). 
To overcome this coverage problem we supplement the output of Buckwalter's analyzer with synthetically constructed analyses that are proposed by a model which uses character information (Diab et al. , 2004) in a way that is similar to Nakagawa's (2004) system for Chinese and Japanese. 
Nakagawa (2004) combine word-level and character-level information for Chinese and Japanese word segmentation.

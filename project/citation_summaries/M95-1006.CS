In addition to these finitestate pattern approaches, a variant of Brill rules has been applied to the problem, as outlined in (Aberdeen et al. , 1995). 
Many research groups are implementing the efficient customization of information extraction systems, such as BBN (Weischedel 1995), NYU (Grishman 1995), SRI (Appelt, Hobbs, et al 1995), SRA (Krupka 1995), MITRE (Aberdeen, Burger, et al 1995), and UMass (Fisher, Soderland, et al 1995). 
4.1 Rules In a typical information extraction task, the most interesting part is the events and relationships holding among the events (Appelt et al. , 1995). 
194 2.2 Previous Approaches to Namefinding Previous approaches have typically used manually constructed finite state patterns (Weischedel, 1995, Appelt et al. , 1995). 
Many research groups are making progress toward efficient customization, such as BBN (Weischedel, 1995), NYU (Grishman, 1995), SRI (Appelt et al. , 1995), SRA (Krupka, 1995), MITRE (Aberdeen et al. , 1995), UMass (Fisher et al. , 1995)etc. SRI developed a specification language called FASTSPEC that automatically translates regular productions written by the developer into finite state machines (Appelt et al. , 1995).

2 Previous work Hardts (1997) algorithm for detecting VPE in the Penn Treebank (see Section 3) achieves precision levels of 44% and recall of 53%, giving an F11 of 48%, using a simple search technique, which relies on the parse annotation having identified empty expressions correctly. 
For most cases of ellipsis, copying of the antecedent clause is enough for resolution (Hardt, 1997).

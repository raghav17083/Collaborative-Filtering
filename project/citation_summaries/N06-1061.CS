Some other possible similarity measures are edit distance, language models (Kurland and Lee, 2005), or generation probabilities (Erkan, 2006). 
Eigenvector centrality in particular has been successfully applied to many different types of networks, including hyperlinked web pages (Brin and Page, 1998; Kleinberg, 1998), lexical networks (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Kurland and Lee, 2005; Kurland and Lee, 2006), and semantic networks (Mihalcea et al. , 2004). 
Some other possible similarity measures are document edit distance, the language models from (Kurland and Lee, 2005), or generation probabilities from (Erkan, 2006). 
For example it has been used to measure centrality in hyperlinked web pages networks (Brin and Page, 1998; Kleinberg, 1998), lexical networks (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Kurland and Lee, 2005; Kurland and Lee, 2006), and semantic networks (Mihalcea et al., 2004). 
Table 4 also shows the results for an asymmetric similarity measure, generation probability (Erkan, 2006) as well as two string edit distances: the longest common substring and the Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1966).

Researchers have explored this problem for a variety of reasons: to argue empirically against the poverty of the stimulus (Clark, 2001), to use induction systems as a first stage in constructing large treebanks (van Zaanen, 2000), or to build better language models (Baker, 1979; Chen, 1995). 
Where van Zaanen (2000) achieved 39.2% unlabeled f-score on ATIS word strings, Clark (2001) reports 42.0% on the same data, and Klein and Manning (2002) obtain 51.2% f-score on ATIS part-of-speech strings using a constituent-context model called CCM. 
A number of studies are related to the work we presented, most specifically work on parallel-text based information projection for parsing (Hwa et al. , 2002), but also grammar induction work based on constituent/distituent information (Klein and Manning, 2002) and (language-internal) alignmentbased learning (van Zaanen, 2000).

Where van Zaanen (2000) and Clark (2001) induced unlabeled phrase structure for small domains like the ATIS, obtaining around 40% unlabeled f-score, Klein and Manning (2002) report 71.1% f-score on Penn WSJ part-of-speech strings  10 words (WSJ10) using a constituentcontext model called CCM.

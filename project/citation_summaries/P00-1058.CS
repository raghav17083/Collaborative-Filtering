2.2 Derivation trees Recent work on the automatic extraction of LTAG (Xia, 1999; Chen and Vijay-Shanker, 2000) and disambiguation models (Chiang, 2000) has been the first on the statistical model for syntactic disambiguation based on lexicalized grammars. 
In addition to adjunction, we also use sister adjunction as de ned in the LTAG statistical parser described in (Chiang, 2000).1 The tree resulting from the combination of elementary trees is is called a derived tree. 
1.3.3 Training a Statistical Parser In order to determine the usefulness of the parser as a preprocessing tool, we used Chiang's parser (Chiang 2000), originally developed for English, which was retrained on data from CTB-I. 
In doing so, we follow the work of others in extracting grammars of various kinds from the PTB, whether it be TAG (Xia, 1999; Chen and Vijay-Shanker, 2000; Chiang, 2000), combinatory categorial grammar (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002), or constraint dependency grammar (Wang and Harper, 2002). 
2 Models and Modifications We will briefly describe the two parsing models employed (for a full description of the BBN model, see (Miller et al. , 1998) and also (Bikel, 2000); for a full description Of the TAG model, see (Chiang, 2000)).

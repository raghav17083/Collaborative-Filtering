3 Automatic Labeling of Semantic Roles For the SR task, we applied a method very similar to the one used in (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2004) for recovering syntactic structures and somewhat similar to the first method for automatic semantic role identification described in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). 
Most of this work has so far focused either on post-processing to recover non-local dependencies from context-free parse trees (Johnson, 2002; Jijkoun and De Rijke, 2004; Levy and Manning, 2004; Campbell, 2004), or on incorporating nonlocal dependency information in nonterminal categories in constituency representations (Dienes and Dubey, 2003; Hockenmaier, 2003; Cahill et al. , 2004) or in the categories used to label arcs in dependency representations (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005).

The pool is used as an instance base to train TiMBL, a memory-based learner (Daelemans et al. , 2003), to predict whether the endpoint of a syntactic path starting at a target word corresponds to a semantic argument, and if so, what its name is. We chose TiMBL for this task because we had previously found that it deals successfully with complex feature spaces and data sparseness (in our case, in the presence of many lexical features) (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2004). 
The parses are converted into dependency relations using a method similar to (Collins, 1999; Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2004).

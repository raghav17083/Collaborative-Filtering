The open-source toolkit SAMT2 (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) is a further evolution of this approach, in which syntactic categories extracted from the target side parse tree are directly assigned to the hierarchically structured phrases. 
The SyntaxAugmented Machine Translation system (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) incorporates target language syntactic constituents in addition to the synchronous grammars used in translation.

We also train two SCFG-based MT systems: a hierarchical phrase-based SMT (Chiang, 2007) system and a syntax augmented machine translation (SAMT) system using the approach described in Zollmann and Venugopal (2006).

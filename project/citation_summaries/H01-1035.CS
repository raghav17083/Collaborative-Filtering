Of significant interest is the porting of annotations across languages: for example, Yarowsky et al. 2001 present a method for automatic tagging of English and the projection of the tags to other languages; however, these tags do not include semantics. 
More recently, researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland have been exploring new ways to exploit parallel corpora in order to develop monolingual resources and tools, using a process of annotation, projection, and training: Given a parallel corpus in English and a less resource-rich language, we project English annotations across the parallel corpus to the second language, using word-level alignments as the bridge, and then use robust statistical techniques in learning from the resulting noisy annotations (Cabezas, Dorr, and Resnik 2001; Diab and Resnik 2002; Hwa et al. 2002; Lopez et al. 2002; Yarowsky, Ngai, and Wicentowski 2001; Yarowsky and Ngai 2001; Riloff, Schafer, and Yarowsky 2002). 
1 Introduction Word-level alignment is a critical component of a wide range of NLP applications, such as construction of bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 2000), word sense disambiguation (Diab and Resnik, 2002), projection of language resources (Yarowsky et al. , 2001), and statistical machine translation. 
On the word or phrase level, these include morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging and NP-bracketing (Yarowsky et al., 2001), temporal analysis (Spreyer and Frank, 2008), or semantic role labeling (Pado and Lapata, 2006). 
One way to avoid the expensive annotation process is to automatically label the training data using annotation projection (Yarowsky et al., 2001): Given a suitable resource (such as a parser) in language L1, and a word-aligned parallel corpus with languages L1 and L2, label the L1portion of the parallel text (with the parser) and copy the annotations to the corresponding (i.e., aligned) elements in language L2.

Then, from step (c) we continue applying rules to untranslated Chinese subtrees, until we get the complete English translation in (e).2 2We swap the 1-best and 2-best parses of the example sentence from our earlier paper (Mi et al., 2008), since the current 1-best parse is easier to illustrate the rule extraction algorithm. 
Among these advances, forest-based modeling (Mi et al., 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008) and tree sequence-based modeling (Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008a) are two interesting modeling methods with promising results reported. 
The first direct application of parse forest in translation is our previous work (Mi et al., 2008) which translates a packed forest from a parser; it is also the base system in our experiments (see below). 
MERT is then performed to optimize the BLEU score on a development set; ForMERT,weuse40randominitialparametersas well as parameters computed using corpus based statistics (Tromble et al., 2008). 
Although such features are applicable to our model, here we attempt to test the models ability to incorporate complex features over sourceside syntax trees, essentially subsuming and extending previous work on tree-to-string translation models (Huang et al., 2006; Mi et al., 2008).

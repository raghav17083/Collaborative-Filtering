We derive a formal property of these signatures that links them to the constraint of well-nestedness, which is an extension of the result for level types (see also Havelka (2007b)). 
The original formulation forbids interleaving of disjoint subtrees in the total order on nodes; we present an equivalent formulation in terms of non-projective edges, derived in (Havelka, 2007b). 
Properties of level types are presented in Havelka (2005; 2007b).6 We propose a new measure combining level types and component degrees. 
The tree-based reranker includes the features described in (Hall, 2007) as well as features based on non-projective edge attributes explored in (Havelka, 2007a; Havelka, 2007b). 
The following result is a direct extension of the results presented in Havelka (2005; 2007b).

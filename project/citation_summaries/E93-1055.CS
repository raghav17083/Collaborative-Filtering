Since there is as yet no comprehensive theory of style, our approach is similar to past approaches, such as those of DiMarco and Hirst (1993), Stede (1993), and Hovy (1988). 
Many stylistic dimensions have been proposed by Hovy (1988), Nirenburg and Defrise (1992), Stede (1993), and others. 
4 DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede (1993) found that whereas some differentiae are easily expressed in terms of clear-cut abstract (or symbolic) features such as 4 The classic opposition of denotation and connotation is not precise enough for our needs here. 
In general, near-synonyms can differ with respect to any aspect of their meaning (Cruse 1986):  denotational variations, in a broad sense, including propositional, fuzzy, and other peripheral aspects  stylistic variations, including dialect and register  expressive variations, including emotive and attitudinal aspects  structural variations, including collocational, selectional, and syntactic variations Building on an earlier analysis by DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede (1993) of the types of differentiae used in synonym discrimination dictionaries, Edmonds (1999) classifies near-synonymic variation into 35 subcategories within the four broad categories above. 
Given a hierarchical organization of coarse-grained language-independent concepts, a set of near-synonyms is simply a set of words that all link to the same language-independent concept (DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede 1993; Hirst 1995).

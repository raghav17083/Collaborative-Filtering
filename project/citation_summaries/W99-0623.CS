Regarding the system combination study, Henderson and Brill (1999) propose two parser combination schemes, one that selects an entire tree from one of the parsers, and one that builds a new tree by selecting constituents suggested by the initial trees. 
Henderson and Brill (1999) examined constituent voting and naive Bayes classifi(:alion for parsing, ol)taining positive results ibr each. 
Ensemble learning has been successfully applied to numerous NLP tasks, including POS tagging (Brill and Wu, 1998; van Halteren et al. , 1998), chunking (Tjong Kim Sang, 2000), word sense disambiguation (Pederson, 2000) and statistical parsing (Henderson and Brill, 1999). 
Henderson and Brill (1999) proposed two parser combination schemes, one that picks an entire tree from one of the parsers, and one that, like ours, builds a new tree from constituents from the initial trees. 
(Henderson and Brill, 1999) improved their best parsers F-measure of 89.7 to 91.3, using their nave Bayes voting on the Penn TreeBank constituent structures (16% error reduction).

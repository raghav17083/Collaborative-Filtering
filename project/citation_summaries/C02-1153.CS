Each terminal class in dimension 2 describes a list of ordered redistributions of functions (e.g. it allows to add an argument for causatives, 9Due to space limitations, we refer to (Prolo, 2002) for a detailed discussion.


(Prolo, 2002) started from 57 elementary trees and 21 handcrafted MetaRules, and re-generated the verb trees of the hand-crafted Xtag grammar for English described in the previous section.


In the context of TAGs, one can cite the notion of MetaRules (Becker, 2000), (Prolo, 2002)8, and the notion of MetaGrammar (Candito, 1996), (Xia, 2001).


A preliminary description of this work, which consist in automatically extracting the hierarchy nodes of a MetaGrammar from the Penn Treebank (i.e. a high level of syntactic abstraction) may be found in (Kinyon and Prolo, 2002).


Some trees generated by (Prolo, 2002) were not in the hand-crafted grammar (e.g. various orderings of by phrase passives) while some others that were in the hand-crafted grammar were not generated by the MetaRules9.

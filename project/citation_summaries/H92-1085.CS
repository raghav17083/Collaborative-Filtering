Although studies of large speech corpora have found that approximately 10% of spontaneous utterances contain disfluencies involving self-correction, or REPAIRS (Hindle, 1983; Shriberg et al. , 1992), little is known about how to integrate repair processing with real-time speech recognition. 
Recently, (Shriberg, Bear, and l)owdlng 1992) proposed a pattern matching method and used it ill GEMINI system(Dowding et al. 1993). 
However, the integration gives rise to some new areas as well: how can an NL component deal with spontaneous speech effects such as false starts and repairs and how can a speech component send information l.o help the NL component (see e.g., Bear et al. 19.q2, Shriberg et al. 1992), how can techniques from the two component areas be effectively combined, and how can prosodic information be effectively communicated between the two components (see, e.g., Price and Ostendorf 1994 for survey). 
Recently, Shriberg et al. 1992 and Bear et al.1992 \[3, 9\] have proposed a two-stage method for processing repairs that integrates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and acoustic information, ha the first stage, lexical pattern matching rules are used to retrieve candidate repair utterances. 
The results can be disastrous for applications, since when a recognizer misrecognizes, a common reaction is to hyperarticulate (Shriberg et al 1992).

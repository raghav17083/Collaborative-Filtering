2 Acquisition of Sense Examples Wang and Carroll (2005) proposed an automatic approach to acquire sense examples from large amount of Chinese text and English-Chinese and Chinese-English dictionaries. 
The intuition is that although machine translated text contains noise, features like word ordering, POS tags 1 A similar process took 15 minutes per noun as reported in (Chan and Ng, 2005), and about an hour for 20 nouns as reported in (Wang and Carroll, 2005). 
Wang and Carroll (2005) proposed to use monolingual corpora and bilingual dictionaries to automatically acquire sense examples. 
As described above, we prepared two sets of training examples for each English word sense to disambiguate: one set was translated word-byword by looking up a bilingual dictionary, as proposed in (Wang and Carroll, 2005), and the other translated using MT software. 
This paper is organised as follows: Section 2 revisits the process of acquiring sense examples proposed in (Wang and Carroll, 2005) and then describes our adapted approach.

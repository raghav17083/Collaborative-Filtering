What is new, however, is that we are using the Internet to obtain values for features in our question classification process, as opposed to previous approaches where the redundancy of information available on the Internet has been used in the answer extraction process (Brill et al. , 2002; Lin et al. , 2002; Katz et al. , 2003). 
In question answering for example, a system may be configured not to answer questions for which the confidence of producing a correct answer is low, and in this way increase the overall accuracy of the system whenever it does produce an answer (Brill et al., 2002; Dredze and Czuba, 2007). 
HOLMES is also related to open-domain questionanswering systems such as Mulder (Kwok et al., 2001), AskMSR (Brill et al., 2002), and others (Harabagiu et al., 2000; Brill et al., 2001). 
In this field as well, the use of pre-defined sets of relation patterns has proved fairly reliable, particularly in the case of factoid type queries (Brill et al. , 2002; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Hovy et al. , 2002; Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2002). 
Moreover, it should be noted that our approach is at the same time very different to other purely web-based approaches such as askMSR (Brill et al. , 2002) and Aranea (Lin et al. , 2002).

In this section we consider two existing grammars: the XTAG grammar, a widecoverage LTAG, and the LEXSYS grammar, a widecoverage D-Tree Substitution Grammar (Rambow et al. , 1995). 
A more recent instance is D-Tree Substitution Grammars #28DSG#29 #28Rambow et al. , 1995#29, where the derivations are also interpreted as dependency relations. 
D-Tree Grammar (DTG) is proposed in (Rambow et al. , 1995) to remedy some empirical and theoretical shortcomings of TAG; Tree Description Grammar (TDG) is introduced in (Kallmeyer, 1999) to support syntactic and semantic underspecification and Interaction Grammar is presented in (Perrier, 2000) as an alternative way of formulating linear logic grammars. 
Sister-adjunction is not an operation found in standard de#0Cnitions of TAG, but is borrowed from D-Tree Grammar #28Rambow et al. , 1995#29. 
This extended sharing is similar to the packing approach employed in the Core Language Engine (Alshawi, 1992), except that the CLE relies on a quasi-logical form to underspecify semantic information such as quantifier scope (the calculation of which is deferred until syntactic ambiguities have been at least partially resolved by other means); whereas the approach described here extends structure sharing to incorporate a certain amount of quantifier scope ambiguity in order to allow a complete evaluation of all subderivations in a shared forest before making any disambiguation decisions in syntax.3 Various synchronous formalisms have been introduced for associating syntactic representations with logical functions in isomorphic or locally non-isomorphic derivations, including Categorial Grammars (CGs) (Wood, 1993), Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) (Joshi, 1985; Shieber and Schabes, 1990; Shieber, 1994), and Synchronous Description Tree Grammars (DTGs) (Rambow et al. , 1995; Rambow and Satta, 1996).

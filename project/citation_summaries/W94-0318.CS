Working in the framework of systemic-functional grammar (SFG), both Wanner (1992) and Teich and Bateman (1994) employ SPL as an intermediate description, but they emphasize the integration of the SPL construction process into SFG. 
Biography generation is an exciting field that has attracted practitioners of NLG in the past (Kim et al. , 2002; Schiffman et al. , 2001; Radev and McKeown, 1997; Teich and Bateman, 1994). 
In related work, Teich, Firzlaff, and Bateman (1994) present an implementation of Kunze's theory of semantic emphasis (cf. 
This is Systemic 43 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Functional Grammar (SFG; (Hallida), 1973; Halliday, 1985)) which is known in computational linguistics foremostl.v by application ill Natural Language Generation (NLG) (e.g. , (Matthiessen and Bateman, 1991; Fawcett and Tucker, 1989; Bateman et al. , 1991; Teich and Bateman, 1994)). 
l Based on previous, separate experiences in natural language generation (see: Teich & Bateman 1994, Bateman & Teich 1995) and in automatic diagram design and visualization (see: Htiser, Reichenberger, Rostek & Streitz 1995), the KOMET-PAVE experiment sought to combine NLG and visualization into a single integrated information presentation system capable  of producing effectively designed pages of information analogous to 'overviews' found in print-based publications such as encyclopediae or magazines.

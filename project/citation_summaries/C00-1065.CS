3The same is true of other algorithms such as (Chen and Vijay-Shanker, 2000)s. 139 their realizations is an important issue here, and is also feasible (see (Kinyon and Prolo, 2002)). 
For instance, TAG does not have an explicit notion of syntactic function: although by convention node indices tend to reflect a function, it is not enforced by the frameworks machinery.1 Hypertags Based on such frameworkand language-neutral syntactic properties, Kinyon (2000) defined the notion of Hypertag (HT), a combination of Supertags (ST) Srinivas (1997) and of the MG. 
Although we can think of simply inserting functional labels in elementary trees or use them in a meta-level to generate the grammar, such as in (Candito, 1998; Kinyon, 2000; Clement and Kinyon, 2003), such tags are generally not seen as an essential part of the derivational process. 
Supertagging is not widely used within the LFG framework, although there has been some work on using hypertags (Kinyon, 2000). 
This amounts to extracting hypertags (Kinyon, 2000) from the treebank, transforming these Hypertags into a MetaGrammar, and automatically generating a TAG from the MG.

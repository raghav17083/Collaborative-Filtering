We have also used TPTs to encode n-gram count databases such as the Google 1T web n-gram database (Brants and Franz, 2006), but are not able to provide detailed results within the space limitations of this paper.4 5.1 Perplexity computation with 5-gram language models We compared the performance of TPT-encoded language models against three other language model implementations: the SRI language modeling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002), IRSTLM (Federico and Cettolo, 2007), and the language model implementation currently used in the Portage SMT system (Badr et al., 2007), which uses a pointer-based implementation but is able to perform fast LM filtering at load time. 
In the second pass, 5-gram and 6-gram zero-cutoff stupid-backoff (Brants et al., 2007) language models estimated using 4.7 billion words of English newswire text are used to generate lattices for phrasal segmentation model rescoring. 
We use the distributed training and application infrastructure described in (Brants et al., 2007) with modifications to allow the training of predictive class-based models and their application in the decoder of the machine translation system. 
Class-based n-gram models have also been shown to benefit from their reduced number of parameters when scaling to higher-order n-grams (Goodman and Gao, 2000), and even despite the increasing size and decreasing sparsity of language model training corpora (Brants et al., 2007), class-based n-gram models might lead to improvements when increasing the n-gram order. 
We build sentencespecific zero-cutoff stupid-backoff (Brants et al., 2007) 5-gram language models, estimated using 4.7B words of English newswire text, and apply them to rescore each 10000-best list.

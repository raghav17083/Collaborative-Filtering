For example, SCFs have been used for verb disambiguation and classification (Schulte im Walde, 2000; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Lapata and Brew, 2004; Merlo et al. , 2005) and SCCs for semantic role labeling (Xue and Palmer, 2004; Punyakanok et al. , 2005). 
In previous work on English, Schulte im Walde (2000) clustered 153 verbs into 30 verb classes taken from Levin (1993), using unsupervised hierarchical clustering. 
The theoretical foundation has been established in extensive work on semantic verb classes such as (Levin, 1993) for English and (Vzquez et al. , 2000) for Spanish: each verb class contains verbs which are similar in their meaning and in their syntactic properties. 
1 Introduction Robust statistical syntactic parsers, made possible by new statistical techniques (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Bikel, 2004) and by the availability of large, hand-annotated training corpora such as WSJ (Marcus et al. , 1993) and Switchboard (Godefrey et al. , 1992), have had a major impact on the field of natural language processing. 
For example, SCFs have been used for verb disambiguation and classification (Schulte im Walde, 2000; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Lapata and Brew, 2004; Merlo et al. , 2005) and SCCs for semantic role labeling (Xue and Palmer, 2004; Punyakanok et al. , 2005).

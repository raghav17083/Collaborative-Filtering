Note that this implies that an unsaturated sign is not associated with one string, but merely with a set of possible strings (this is similar to the semantic interpretation of unsaturated signs (Moore, 1989)). 
4 Related Work After a period of active research within the logicbased paradigm (e.g. , Charniak and Goldman (1988), Moore (1989), Pereira and Pollack (1991)), work on semantic interpretation has almost ceased with the emergence of the empiricist movement in NLP (cf. 
Pereira and Shieber (1987) propose to "encode" Montague's ideas in unification grammar, while Moore (1989) fears that building logical forms with unification grammar is "unprincipled feature hacking". 
(Moore, 1989) suggests that the way to overcome this problem is to use explicit A-terms and encode /~-reduction to perform the needed reduction. 
1 Introduction Semantic interpretation has been an actively investigated issue on the research agenda of the logic-based paradigm of NLP in the late eighties (e.g. , Charniak and Goldman (1988), Moore (1989), Pereira and Pollack (1991)).

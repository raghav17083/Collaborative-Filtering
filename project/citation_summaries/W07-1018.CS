Fiszman et al. focused on extracting the drug names, the scale and the position on the scale as illustrated in the SemRep representation from example (1): (4) Losartan COMPARED_WITH Atenolol Scale: Effectivness Losartan HIGHER_THAN Atenolol [Example (21) in (Fiszman et al. 2007)] The overall F-score for the SemRep performance on the test set is 81% . Fiszman et al. do not deal with questions, nor with identifying the basis of the comparison or the population in this paper, both of which are important for generating relevant answers for clinical questions. 
4 Strategies  for  Retrieving  MEDLINE Abstracts As with (Fiszman et al., 2007) and (Demner-Fushman and Lin 2006),  the current work starts with information retrieval. 
Fiszman et al (2007) studied the problem of identifying which entity has more of certain features in comparative sentences. 
3.1  Interpretation of Comparative Structures (Fiszman et al., 2007) describes work on automatically interpreting comparative constructions in MEDLINE abstracts. 
One existing focused study is on comparative and superlative sentences (Jindal and Liu, 2006; Bos and Nissim, 2006; Fiszman et al, 2007; Ganapathibhotla and Liu, 2008).

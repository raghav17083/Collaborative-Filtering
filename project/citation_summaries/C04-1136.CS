6Following Evert (2004), signi cance was computed using Fishers exact test (at p = 0.05) to compare the n-best word pairs from the scored test sets, where n was taken as the number of positive pairs in the set.


Following the method proposed by Evert (2004), we applied Fishers exact test to counts of word pairs that are accepted by only one of the two tested algorithms.

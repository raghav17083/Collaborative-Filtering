Lexical cohesion relations (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) between words were identified in RT and used to construct lexical chains of related words in five texts (Morris and Hirst, 1991). 
Morris and Hirst (1991) structured a set of magazine texts using the theory of (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), developed a thesaurus-based lexical cohesion algorithm to segment text, then qualitatively compared their segmentations with the results. 
Morris and Hirst (1991) at first proposed a manual method for computing lexical chains and first computational model of lexical chains was introduced by Hirst and St-Onge (1997). 
Also, salient entities are differentiated from casually occurring entities, based on the widely used assumption that occurrence frequency correlates with discourse prominence (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Grosz et al. , 1995). 
hnplementations of this idea use word stem repetition (Youmans, 1991; Reynar, 1994; Ponte and Croft, 1997), context vectors (Hearst, 1994; Yaari, 1997; Kaufmann, 1999; Eichmann et al. , 1999), entity repetition (Kan et al. , 1998), semantic similarity (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Kozima, 1993), word distance model (Beeferman et al. , 1997a) and word frequency model (Reynar, 1999) to detect cohesion.

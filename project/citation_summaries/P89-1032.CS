3 Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 1 b. Assign: Take the first index i of the stack copied into the NP j node, and annotate NP j with j = i. c. Collect: Add index j to A in each sister node of NP j . When a local domain border is crossed: d. Reset: Reset B to A [ B. This algorithm has been given two different implementations, one by Correa (1988), the other by Ingria and Stallard (1989). 
Most published computational algorithms of anaphora resolution, including (Hobbs, 1978; Lappin and Leass, 1994; Ingria and Stallard, 1989), rely on such binding-constraint filters to minimize the set of potential antecedents for pronouns and reflexives. 
We are currently starting to port the DE generation component to the BBN Spoken Language System (Boisen et al. , 1989), and plan to integrate it with the intra-sentential mechanisms in (Ingria and Stallard, 1989). 
Mechanisms of this kind are required for implementations of Chomsky's binding theory in Government Binding-based parsers, such as those described in Correa (1988) and Ingria and Stallard (1989). 
These primitive relations can be considered declarative equivalents to the procedural specifications used in several tree-walking algorithms for anaphora resolution, e.g., by Hobbs (1978) or Ingria and Stallard (1989).

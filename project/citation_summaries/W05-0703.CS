For details, see (Habash et al. , 2005).


It has been used to describe the morphology of Syriac (Kiraz, 2000), Akkadian (Barthelemy, 2006) and Arabic Dialects (Habash et al. , 2005).


In Section 2, before we focus on the principles of ElixirFM, we briefly follow the characterization of morphological theories presented by Stump (2001) and extend the classification to the most prominent computational models of Arabic morphology (Beesley, 2001; Buckwalter, 2002; Habash et al. , 2005; El Dada and Ranta, 2006).


(Habash et al. , 2005), and our model will encourage this.


The computational models in (Soudi et al. , 2001) and (Habash et al. , 2005) attempt the inferential??

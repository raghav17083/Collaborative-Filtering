A few works (Xing et al. , 2002; Bar-Hillel et al. , 2003; Schultz and Joachims, 2004; Mochihashi et al. , 2004) outside the NLP domain have also pursued this general direction, and some have tried to learn the metric with limited amount of supervision, no supervision or by incorporating other information sources such as constraints on the class memberships of the data elements.

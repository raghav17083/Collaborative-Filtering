The '90s have in fact seen a renewed interest in grammar checking, and proposals have been made for systems covering English (Bernth, 1997) and other languages such as Italian (Bolioli et al. , 1992), Spanish and Greek (Bustamante and Ldon, 1996), Czech (Holan et al. , 1997) and Swedish (Hein, 1998).

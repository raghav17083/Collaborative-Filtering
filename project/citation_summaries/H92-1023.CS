There are many POS taggers developed using different techniques for many major languages such as transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill, 1995), decision trees (Black et al., 1992), Markov model (Cutting et al., 1992), maximum entropy methods (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) etc for English. 
Almost all of the work in the area of automatically trained taggers has explored Markov-model based part of speech tagging \[Jelinek, 1985; Church, 1988; Derose, 1988; DeMarcken, 1990; Cutting et al. , 1992; Kupiec, 1992; Charniak et al. , 1993; Weischedel et al. , 1993; Schutze and Singer, 1994; Lin et al. , 1994; Elworthy, 1994; Merialdo, 1995\]. 
This corpus-based information typically concerns sequences of 1-3 tags or words (with some well-known exceptions, e.g. Cutting et al. 1992). 
For English there are many POS taggers, employing machine learning techniques like transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill, 1995), decision trees (Black et al. , 1992), markov model (Cutting et al. 1992), maximum entropy methods (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) etc. There are also taggers which are hybrid using both stochastic and rule-based approaches, such as CLAWS (Garside and Smith, 1997). 
2Some other approaches to tagging are described in \[Hindle, 1989; Black et al. , 1992\].

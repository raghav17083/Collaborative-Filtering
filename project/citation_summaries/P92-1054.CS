Introduction Word sense disambiguation (WSD) has been found useful in many natural language processing (NLP) applications, including information retrieval (Krovetz and Croft 1992; McRoy 1992), machine translation (Brown et al. 1991; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Dagan and Itai 1994), and speech synthesis (Yarowsky 1992).


Towards a Meaning-Full Comparison of Lexieal Resources Kenneth C Lltkowska CL Research 9208 Gue Road Damascus, MD 20872 ken@clres corn http//www tires tom Abstract The mapping from WordNet to Hector senses m Senseval provides a "gold standard" against wluch to judge our ability to compare lexlcal resources The "gold standard" is provided through a word overlap analysis (with and without a stop list) for flus mapping, achieving at most a 36 percent correct mapping (inflated by 9 percent from "empty" assignments) An alternaUve componenttal analysis of the defimtaons, using syntacUc, collocatmnal, and semantac component and relation identification (through the use ofdefimng patterns integrated seamlessly mto the parsing thclaonary), provides an almost 41 percent correct mapping, with an additaonal 4 percent by recogmzmg semantic components not used in the Senseval mapping Defimtion sets of the Senseval words from three pubhshed thclaonanes and Dorr's lextcal knowledge base were added to WordNet and the Hector database to exanune the nature of the mapping process between defimtton sets of more and less sco\[~e The tecbauques described here consUtute only an maaal implementation of the componenUal analysis approach and suggests that considerable further improvements can be aclueved Introduction The difficulty of companng lemcal resources, long a s~gnfficant challenge in computauonal hnguistlcs (Atlans, 1991), came to the fore in the recent Senseval competatton (IOlgarnff, 1998), when some systems that relied heavily on the WordNet (Miller, et al, 1990) sense inventory were faced with the necessity of using another sense inventory (Hecto0 A hasty solutaon to the problem was the " development of a map between the two inventories, but some part~cipants expressed concerns that use of flus map may have degraded their performance to an unknown degree Although there were disclaimers about the WordNet-Hector map, it nonetheless stands as a usable gold standard for efforts to compare lexical resources Moreover, we have a usable baseline (a word overlap method suggested m (Lesk, 1986)) against which to compare whether we are able to make improvements m the mapping (since flus method has been shown to perform not as well as expected (Krovetz, 1992)) We first describe the lextcal resources used m the study (Hector, WordNet, other dicUonanes, and a lex~cal knowledge base), first characterizing them in terms ofpolysemy and the types of leracal mformaUon each contmns (syntacUc properties and features, semantac components and relaUons, and collocaUonal properties) We then present results of perfornung the word overlap analysis of the 18 verbs used m Senseval, analyzing the definitions m WordNet and Hector We then expand our analysis to include other dictionaries We describe our methods of analysis, particularly the methods of parsing defimtaons and identff)qng semantic relations (semrels) based on defimng patterns, essentially takang first steps m Implementing the program described by Atkms and focusmg on the use of"meamng" full mformataon rather than statistical mformaUon We identify the results that have been achieved thus far and outline further steps that may add more "meanmg" to the analysis IAll analyses described m this paper were performed automatically using functlonahty incorporated m DIMAP (Dictionary Maintenance Programs) (available for immediate download at (CL Research, 1999a)) This includes automatac extracuon of WordNet reformation for the selected words (mtegrated m DIMAP) Hector defimtlons were uploaded into DIMAP dicUonanes after use of a conversmn program Defimtlons for other 30 The Lexical Resources Tlus analysis focuses on the mmn verb senses used In Senseval (not ichoms and phrases), specifically the followmg AMAZE, BAND, BET, BOTHER, BURY, CALCULATE, CONSUME, DERIVE, FLOAT, HURDLE, INVADE, PROMISE, SACK, SANCTION, SCRAP, SEIZE, SHAKE, SLIGHT The Hector database used In Senseval consists of a tree of senses, each of which contains defimttons, syntactic properties, example usages, and "clues" (collocational information about the syntactic and semantic enwronment in wluch a word appears in the spectfic sense) The WordNet database contmns synonyms (synsets), perhaps a defimtton or example usages (gloss), some syntactic mformaUon (verb frames), hypernyms, hyponyms, and some other semrels (ENTAILS, CAUSES) To extend our analysis In order to look at other issues of lexacal resource comparison, we have included the defirauons or leracal information from the following additional sources  Webster's 3 ra New International Dictionary (W3)  Oxford Advanced l.earners D~ctlonary (OALD)  American Hentage DlcUonary (AI-ID)  Dorr's Lexacal Knowledge Base (Dorr) We used only the defimuons from W3, OALD, and AHD (which also contmn sample usages and some collocattonal information m the form of usage notes, not used at the present tame) Dorr's database contains thematic grids wluch characterize the thematic roles of obligatory and optional semanuc components, frequently identifying accompanying preposmons (Olsen, et al, 1998) The following table identities

lexicographer's mappmg from WordNet 1 6 to Hector, using a s~mple word overlap analysis smular to (Lesk, 1986) The lextcographer mapped the 66 WordNet senses (each synset m which a test occurred) Into 102 Hector senses A total of 86 assignments were made, 9 WordNet senses were gwen no assignments, 40 recewed exactly one, and 17 senses received 2 or 3 asssgnments The WordNet senses contained 348 words (about half of wluch were common words appeanng on our stop list, which contained 165 words, mostly preposmons, pronouns, and conjunctions) The Hector senses selected m the word overlap analysis contained about 960 words (all Hector senses contained 1878 words) We performed a strict word overlap analysts (with and wsthout a stop hst) between tile definlUons in WordNet and the Hector senses, that is, we did not attempt to ldenttfy root forms of Inflected words We took each word m a WordNet sense and determined whether ~t appeared in a Hector sense, we selected a Hector sense based on the highest percentage of words over all Hector senses An 31 empty selection was made ff all the words in the WordNet sense did not appear in any Hector sense, only content words were considered when the stop hst was used For example, for bet, WordNet sense 2 (stake (money) on the outcome of an issue) mapped into Hector sense 4 ((of a person) to risk (a sum of money or property) m thts way) In this case, there was an overlap on two words (money, 039 in the Hector defimtlon (0 13 of its 15 words) without the stop list When the stop list was invoked, there was an overlap of only one word (money, 0 07 of the Hector defimtion) In this case, the lexicographer had made three assignments (Hector senses 2, 3, and 4), our scoring method treated flus as only 1 out of 3 correct (not using the relaxed method employed in Senseval of treating flus as completely correct) Without the stop hst, our selections matched the lexicographer's in 28 of 86 cases (32 6%), using the stop list, we were successful in 31 of 86 cases (36 1%) The improvement arising when the stop list was used is deceptive, where 8 cases were due to empty assignments (so that only 23 cases, 26 7%, were due to matching content words) Overall, only 41 content words were involved in these 23 successes when the stop list was used, an average of I 8 content words To summanze the word overlap analysis (1) despite a ncher set of defimtions in Hector, 9 of 66 WordNet senses (13 6%) could not be assigned, (2) despite the greater detail in Hector senses compared to WordNet senses (2 8 times as many words), only 1 8 content words participated in the assignments, and (3) therefore, the defimng vocabulary between these two definition sets seems to be somewhat divergent Although it might appear as if the word overlap analysis does not perform well, this is not the case The analysis provides a broad overview of the defimuon companson process between two definmon sets and frames a deeper analysis of the differences Moreover, it appears that the accuracy of a "gold standard" mapping is not crucially important The quality of the mapping may help frame the subsequent analysis more precisely, but it seems sufficient that any reasonable mapping will suffice This will be discussed further after presenting the results of the componentlal analysis of the defimtlons 32 Meaning-Full Analysis of Definitions The deeper analysis of the mapping between two defimtion sets relies primarily on two major steps (1) parsing definitions and using defimng patterns to identify semrels present m the definitions and (2) relaxing values to these relations by allowing "synonymic" substitution (using WordNet) Thus, for example, ffwe identify hypernyms or instruments from parsing a defimtion, we would say that the defimtions are "equal" not just ffthe hypernym or instrument is the same word, but also Lf the hypernyms or instruments are members of the same synset This approach is based on the finding (Litkowski, 1978) that a dictionary induces a semantic network where nodes represent "concepts" that may be lexicahzed and verbalized in more than one way This finding implies, in general, the absence of true synonyms, and instead the kind of "concept" embodied in WordNet synsets (with several lexical items and phraseologles) A slmdar approach, parsing defimtlons and relaxing semrel values, was followed in (Dolan, 1994) for clnstenng related senses w~thin a single dictionary The ideal toward which this approach strives is a complete identification of the meamng components included in a defimtion The meaning components can include syntactic features and charactenstlcs (including subcategonzation patterns), semantm components (realized through identification of semrels), selectional restrictions, and coUocational specifications The first stage of the analysis parses the definitions (CL Research, 1999b, Litkowski, to appear) and uses the parse results to extract (via defining patterns) semrels Since definitions have many idiosyncrasies (that do not follow ordinary text), an important first step in this stage is preprocessmg the definition text to put it into a sentence frame that facilitates the extraction of semrels 2 2Note that the stop hst is not applicable to the definition parsing The parser is a full-scale sentence parser, where prepositmns and other words on the stop list are necessary for successful parsing Moreover, inclusion of the prepositions is cmcml to the method, since they are the bearers of much semrel information The extractmn of semrels examines the parse results, a e, a tree whose mtermedaate nodes represent non-ternunals and whose leaves represent the lextcal atems that compnse the defimuons, where any node may also include annotations such as characterizations of number and tense For all noun or verb defimttons, flus includes Identification of the head noun (with recogmtton of"empty" heads) or verb, for verbs, we signal whether the defimtaon contmned any selecttonal restnctmus (that as, pamcular parenthesazed expressaons) for the subject and object We then exanune preposattonal phrases In the defimUon and deterrmne whether we have a "defining pattern" for the preposaUon whach we can use as mdacaUve of a partacular semrel We also identify adverbs m the parse tree and look these up in WordNet to adentffy an adjecuve synset from wluch they are derived (if one is gwen) The defimng pattems are actually part of the dictionary used by the parser That is, we do not have to develop specafic routines to look for specLfic patterns A defimng pattern ~s a regular expressaon that arlaculates a syntactac pattern to be matched Thus, to recograze a "manner" semrel, we have the foUowmg entry for "m" m(dpat((~ rep0 l(det(0)) adj manner(0) st(manner)))) This allows us to recognize "m" as possibly gwmg rise to a "manner" component, where we recogmze "m" (the tdde, which allows us to specify partacular elements before the "m" as well), vath a noun phrase that consasts of 0 or 1 determiner, an adjectwe, and the lateral "manner" The '0  after the detenmner and the hteral mdacate that these words are not copied into the value for a "manner" role, so that the value to the "manner" semrel becomes only the adjectwe that as recogmzed The second stage of the analysis uses the populated lexacal database to compare senses and make the selectaons This process follows the general methodology used m Senseval (Lltkowska, to appear) Specifically, m the defimtaon comparison, we first exanune exclusaon cntena to rule out specific mappings These criteria include syntacUc properUes (e g, a verb sense that Is only transluve cannot map into one that Is only mtransRave) and collocataonal propertaes (e g, a sense that is used with a parUcle cannot map into one that uses a different particle) At the present tune, these are used only rmmmally 33 We next score each viable sense based on rots semrels We increment the score ff the senses have a common hypernym or If a sense's hypernyms belong  to the same synset as the other sense's hypernyms If a parUcular sense con~ns a large number of synonyms (that as, no differentiae on the hypernym) and they overlap consaderably m the synsets they evoke, the score can be increased substanUally Currently, we add 5 points for each match 3 We increment the score based on common semrels In tins amtml tmplementaUon, we have defimng patterns (usually qmte nummal) for recogmzmg Instrument, means, location, purpose, source, manner, has-constituents, has-members, is-part-of, locale, and goal 4 We Increment the score by 2 points when we have a common semrel and then by another 5 points when the value Is ~dentacal or m the same synset After all possable increments to the scores have been made, we then select the sense(s) w~th the lughest score Finally, we compare our selecuon with that of the gold standard to assess our mapping over all senses Another way an wluch our methodology follows the Senseval process as that at proceeds incrementally Thus, ~t ms not necessary to have a "final" perfect parse and mapping rouUne We can make conUnual refinements at any stage of the process and exarmne the overall effect As m Senseval, we may make changes to deal wath a particular phenomenon with the result that overall performance dechnes, but w~th a sounder basis for making subsequent amprovements Results of Componential Analysis The "gold standard" analysis Involves mapping 66 WordNet senses with 348 words into 102 Hector senses with 1878 words Using the method described above, we obtained 35 out of 86 correct 3At the present tame, we use WordNet to adentffy semreis We envaslon usmg the full semanlac network created by parsing all a dlcUonary's defimtaons Thas would include a richer set of semrels than currently included m WordNet 4The defimng patterns are developed by hand We have onlyJust begun this effort, so the current set ms somewhat Impoverished mappmgs (407%), a shght improvement over the 31 correct assignments usmg the stop-last word overlap techmque However, as mentioned above, the stophst techmque had aclueved 8 of its successes by matclung null assignments Consadered on tlus basins, ~t seems that the componentaal analysis techmque provides substantial ~mprovement In addition, our technique "erred" on 4 cases by malang assagnments where none were made by the leracographer We suggest that these cases do con~n some common elements of meaning and may conceivably not be construed as errors The mapping from WordNet to Hector had relatavely few empty mappings, senses for wtuch It was not possable to make an assignment These are the cases where at appears that the chetmnanes do not overlap and thus prowde a tentative mdacataon of where two dictionaries may have different coverage The cases of multiple assignments mchcate the degree ofamblgmty m the mapping The average m both darecUons between Hector and WordNet were donunated by the mabdaty to obtain good dascnnunatton for the word "semze" Thus, tlus method identifies individual words where the &scnnunatwe ablhty needs to be further refined  Perhaps more importantly, the componentml analysis method exploits consaderably more WordNet Hector  mformauon than the word overlap methods Whereas the stop-hst word overlap mapping was  based on only 41 content words, the componenual ~ approach (In the selected mappings) had 228 hits in ~.~  developing ats scores, with only a small number of ~ .~ ~ defining patterns Comparison of Dictionaries tel O ~3 0'3 We next exanuned the nature of the mterrelalaons between parrs of chctaonanes w~thout use of a "gold standard" to assess the process of mapping For t/us purpose, we mapped m both &recttons between the paars {WordNet, Hector}, {W3, OALD}, and {W3, AHD We exanune Dorr's lexacal knowledge base for the amphcatlons It may have m the mapping process Neither WordNet nor Hector are properly v~ewed as chcuonanes, since there was no mtenuon to pubhsh them as such WordNet "glosses" are generally smaller (53 words per sense) compared to Hector (184 words per sense), whach contains many words specff3nng selectmnal restnct~ons on the subject and object of the verbs Hector was used primarily for a large-scale sense tagging project The three formal d~ctmnanes were subject to rigorous pubhslung and style standards The average number of words per sense were 87 (OALD), 7 1 (AHD), and 9 9 (W3), w~th an average of 3 4, 62, and 120 senses per word Each table shows the average number of senses being mapped, the average number of assignments m the target dlCtmnary, the average number of senses for which no assagnment could be made, the average number of mulUple assignments per word, and the average score of the assignments that were made WN-Hector 37 47 06 17 119 Hector-WN 57 64 14 22 113 These points are further emphasized m the mapping between W3 and OALD, where the disparity between the empty and mulUple assagnments indicate that we are mapping between dictionaries qmte disparate This tends to be the case not only for the enUre set of words, but also is evident for individual words where there is a considerable d~spanty m the number of senses, wtuch then dominate the overall dlspanty Thus, for example, W3 has 41 defimUons for "float", while OALD has 10 We tend to be unable to find the specific sense m going from W3 to OALD, because at is likely that we have many more specific defimtlons that are not present In the other direction, we are hkely to have considerable ambiguity and multiple assignments W3-OALD OALD-W3 W3 OALD 120 78 60 18 99 34 60 07 32 86 34 A Between W3 and AHD, there ss less overall daspanty between the defimtaon sets, although since W3 Is tmabndged, we stall have a relatavely lugh number of senses m W3 that do not appear to be present m AHD Finally, It should be noted that the scores for the published dictaonanes tend to be a little lower than for WordNet and Hector Tlus reflects the hkehhood that we have not extracted as much mformataon as we dad m parsing and analyzmg the defimtaon sets used m Senseval W3 AHD oJ  'q O W3-AHD 120 115 40 36 90 AHD-W3 6 2 9 1 1 2 4 1 9 1 We next considered Dorr's lexacal database We first transformed her theta grids to syntactic spectflcataons (transttave or lntransmttve) and identtficataon of semreis (e g, where she Identified an instr component, we added such a semrel to the DIMAP sense) We were able to identify a mappmg from WordNet to her senses for two words ("float" and "shake") for wluch Dorr has several entries However, smce she has considerably more semanuc components than we are currently able to recogmze, we dad not pursue this avenue any further at flus time More important than just mappmg between two words, Dorr's data mdacates the posstbday of further exploitation of a richer set of semanUc components Spectfically, as reported m (Olsen, et al, 1998), m descnbmg procedures for automatically acqumng thematic grids for Mandann Chinese, ~t was noted that "verbs that incorporate themaUc elements m their meamng would not allow that element to appear m the complement structure" Thus, by usmg Dorr's thematic grids when verb are parsed m defimtaons, it ~s possible to ~dentffy where partacular semantac components are lexicahzed and which others are transnutted through to the themaUc grid (complement or subcategonzataon pattern) for the defimendum The transmiss~on of semantic components to the thematic gnd ~s also reflected overtly m many defimtlons For example, shake has one definition, "to bnng to a specified condatton by or as ffby repeated qmck jerky movements" We would thus expect that the thematac grid for this defimtaon should include a "goal" And, deed, Dorr's database has two senses whch reqmre a "goal" as part of their thematic grid Smularly, for many defimtaons m the sample set, we ~dentLfied a source defimng pattern based on the word "from," frequently, the object of the preposmon was the word "source" ttseff, mdacatmg that the subcategonzaUon, properties of the defimendum should elude a source component Discussion Wlule the improvement m mapping by using the componentaal analysis techmque (over the word overlap methods) is modest, we consider these results qmte slgmficant m wew of the very small number of defimng patterns we have Implemented Most of the improvement stems from the word substatuUon pnnclple described earlier (as ewdenced by the preponderance of 5 point scores) This techmque also provides a mechamsm for bnngmg back the stop words, wz, the preposmons, wluch are the careers of mformatmn about semrels (the 2 point scores) The more general conclusion (from the word subsutuuon) is that the success arises from no longer considenng a defimtmn m ~solation The proper context for a word and its defimtions consists not .lUSt of the words that make up the definition, but also the total semantac network represented by the dictaonary We have aclueved our results by explomng only a small part of that network We have moved only a few steps to that network beyond the mdawdual words and their definitions We would expect that further expansmn, first by the addon of further and ~mproved semrel defining patterns, and second, through the identaficataon of more pnmmve semanuc components, will add considerably to our abflay to map between lexacal resources We also expect ~mprovements from consideration of other techniques, such as attempts at ontology ahgnment (Hovy, 1998) Although tile definition analysis provlded here was performed on definmons with a stogie language, the vanous meamng components m m m m m m m m 35 correspond to those used in an Interhngua The use of the exUncuon method (developed m order to charactenze verbs m another language, Clunese) can frmtfully be applied here as well Two further observaUons about tlus process can be made The first is that rchance on a wellestablished semantic network such as WordNet,s not necessary The componenUal analysis method rehes on the local neighborhood of words m the defimUons, not on the completeness of the network Indeed, the network ~tsel can be bootstrapped based on the parsing results The method can work vath any semanUc network or ontology and may be used to refine or flesh out the network or ontology The second observation is that it is not necessary to have a well-estabhshed "gold standard" Any mapping vail do All that Is necessary is for any mvesugator (lemcographer or not) to create a judgmental mappmg The methods employed here can then quanufy ttus mapping based on a word overlap analysis and then further examine tt based on the componenaal analysis The componenUal analysis method can then be used to exanune underlying subtleUes and nuances tn the defimUous, wluch a lemcographer or analyst can then examine m further detail to assess the mapping Future Work Tlus work has marked the first ume that all the necessary mfrastructure has been combmed tn a rudimentary form Because of its rudimentary status, the opportumUes for improvement are quite extensive In addlUon, there are many opportumUes for using the techmques descnbed here m further NLP apphcatlons First, the techmques described here have immediate apphcabtllty as part of a lexicographer's workstaUon When defimUons are parsed and semrels are zdenttfied, the resulUng data structures can be apphed against a corpus of instances for parUcular words (as m Senseval) for improving word-sense disamblguaUon The techmques will also permit comparing an entry vath Itself to deternune the mterrelattonshtps among ~ts defimUons and of companng the defimUons of two "synonyms" to deternune the amount of overlap between them on a defimtlon by defimUon bas~s Although the analys,s here has focused on the parsing of defimUous, the development of defimng patterns clearly extends to generalized text parsing since the defimng patterns have been incorporated mto the same chcttonary used for parsing free text, the patterns can be used threctly to identify the presence of parUcular semrels among sentenual consUtuents We are working to integrate th~s funcUonahty into our word-sense &sambiguaUon techruques (both the defimng patterns and the semrels) Even further, mt seems that matclung defimng patterns in free text can be used for lextcal acquisition Textual matenal that contains these patterns could concewably be flagged as providing defimUonal matenal which can then be compared to emstmg defimUons to assess whether their use ts cous,stent vath these defimUons, and ff not, at least to flag the inconsistency The tecluuques descnbed here can be apphed directly to the fields of ontology development and analysis of ternunologlcal databases For ontoiogles, vath or w~thout defimuons, the methods employed can be used to compare entries m dai'erent ontologles based pnmanly on the relattous m the ontology, both luerarclucal and other For ternunologlcal databases, the methods descnbed here can be used to exanune the set of conceptual relaUons lmphed by the defimtmus The defimuon parsing wall facd~tate the development of the termmolog~ca I network tn the pamcular field covered by the database The componenUal analysts methods result m a richer semantic network that can be used m other apphcattous Thus, for example, ~t ts possible to extend the leracal chatmng methods described m (Green, 1997), which are based on the semrels used m WordNet The semrels developed with the componenttal analysis method would provide additional detad available for apphcauon of lexlcal cohesion methods In particular, addtUonal relattous would penmt some structunng wmthm the individual leracal chams, rather than just consldenng each cham as an amorphous set (Green, 1999) Finally, we are currently investigating the use of the componenUal analysts techmque for mformauon extracUon The techmque identifies (from defimtlous) slots that can be used as slots or fields m template generataon Once these slots are identified, we wall be attemptmg to extract slot values from Items m large catalog databases (mdhons of items) 36 In conclusion, it would seem that, instead of a paucity of tnformation allovang us to compare lexmal resources, by bnngmg m the full semantic network of the lexicon, we are overwhelmed with a plethora of data Acknowledgments I would like to thank Bonnie Dorr, Chnstiane Fellbaum, Steve Green, Ed Hovy, Ramesh Knshnamurthy,

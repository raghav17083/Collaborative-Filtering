Several studies have shown that extracting modifier-head pairs from text and including these as compound indexing terms can improve recall and precision (Evans and Zhai, 1996; Pohlmann and Kraaij, 1997; Strzalkowski and Vauthey, 1992). 
To the extent that translation-oriented definitions of compositionality overlap with other definitions, NCC lists derived from parallel data may benefit other applications where NCCs play a role, such as information retrieval (Evans & Zhai, 1996) and language modeling for speech recognition (Ries et al. , 1996). 
Several researchers (e.g. , (Barker, 1998; Evans and Zhai, 1996; Pohlmann and Kraaij, 1997; Pustejovsky et al. , 1993; Strzalkowski and Vauthey, 1992)) collect statistics on the occurrence frequency of structurally unambiguous two-noun compounds to inform the analysis of the ambiguous compound. 
2 The NLP Techniques The natural language processing techniques used in this system are well known, including in information retrieval applications (St.rzalkowski, 1993), (Strzalkowski, Perez Carballo and Marinescu, 1995), (Evans and Zhai, 1996).

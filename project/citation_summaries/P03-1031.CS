A list of states was also used in (Higashinaka et al., 2003) to represent uncertainty, but no formal semantics was provided for this list, and therefore only heuristic uses were suggested for it.


This is in contrast to the supervised learning approach of learning system behaviour based on a fixed corpus (Higashinaka et al., 2003).

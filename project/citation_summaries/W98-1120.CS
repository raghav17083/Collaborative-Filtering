A wide variety of machine learning methods have been applied to this problem, including Hidden Markov Models (Bikel et al. 1997), Maximum Entropy methods (Borthwick et al. 1998, Chieu and Ng 2002), Decision Trees (Sekine et al. 1998), Conditional Random Fields (McCallum and Li 2003), Class-based Language Model (Sun et al. 2002), Agent-based Approach (Ye et al. 2002) and Support Vector Machines. 
Several POC-tag sets have been studied (Sang and Veenstra, 1999; Sekine et al. , 1998), and we use the B, I, E, S tag set shown in Table 1 1. 
This approach is also used in base-NP chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) and named entity recognition (Sekine et al. , 1998) as well as word segmentation. 
The latter is currently dominating in NER amongst which the most popular methods are decision tree (Sekine et al. , 1998; Pailouras et al. , 2000), Hidden Markov Model (Zhang et al. , 2003; Zhao, 2004), maximum entropy (Chieu and Ng, 2002; Bender et al. , 2003), and support vector machines (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002; Takeuchi and Collier, 2002; Mayfield, 2003). 
1The B, I, E, S tags are also called OP-CN, CN-CN, CNCL, OP-CL tags (Sekine et al. , 1998) or LL, MM, RR, LR tags (Xue, 2003).

Since it is not feasible to maximise the likelihood of the observations directly, we maximise the expected log likelihood by considering the EM auxiliary function, in a similar manner to that used for modelling contextual variations of phones for ASR (Young et al., 1994; Singer and Ostendorf, 1996).

The development of ef cient estimation procedures for context-dependent acoustic models revolutionised the  eld of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) (Young et al., 1994).

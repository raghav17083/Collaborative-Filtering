Most existing systems separate semantic role labeling into two sub-problems, boundary recognition and role classification, and use feature-based models to address both (Carreras et al. , 2004). 
??Partial parsing path as described in (Carreras et al. , 2004)); All 3/4/5-grams of path elements beginning at the verb predicate or ending at the constituent. 
Several exceptions to this described architecture for SRL can be found in the literature.One approach entails joint labeling of all predicates of the sentence, instead of proceeding one by one.This opens the possibility of exploiting dependencies among the different verbs in the sentence.However, the complexity may grow signicantly, and results so far are inconclusive (Carreras, M`arquez, and Chrupaa 2004; Surdeanu et al. 2007).Other promising approaches draw on dependency parsing rather than traditional phrase structure parsing (Johansson and Nugues 2007), or combine parsing and SRL into a single step of semantic parsing (Musillo and Merlo 2006).

The overall results on the Development, Test-WSJ, Test-Brown, and TestWSJ+Brown datasets for F-score are 65.78, 67.91, 58.58 and 66.72 respectively, which are moderate compared to the best result reported in CoNLL2004 Shared Task (Carreras et al. , 2004) using partial trees and the result in (Pradhan et al. , 2004).

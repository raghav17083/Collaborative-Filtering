We adopt the sense inventory from the Preposition Project (TPP) (Litkowski and Hargraves, 2005) that was also used in the SemEval 2007 preposition WSD task (Litkowski and Hargraves, 2007). 
5.EmpiricalEvaluationsofSRLSystems Many experimental studies have been conducted since the work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), including seven international evaluation tasks in ACL-related conferences and workshops: the SIGNLL CoNLL shared tasks in 2004 and 2005 (Carreras and M`arquez 2004, 2005), the SIGLEX Senseval-3 in 2004 (Litkowski 2004), and four tasks in the SIGLEX SemEval in 2007 (Pradhan et al.2007; M `arquez et al.2007; Baker, Ellsworth, and Erk 2007; Litkowski and Hargraves 2007).In the subsequent sections, we summarize their main features, results, and conclusions, although note that the scores are not directly comparable across different exercises, due to differences in scoring and in the experimental methodologies. 
6 WSD of Prepositions The Word Sense Disambiguation of Prepositions Task (Litkowski and Hargraves, 2007), provided training and test data for sense disambiguation of 34 prepositions. 
Joint scoring and combination components open the door to richer types of features, which may take into account global properties of the candidate solution plus dependencies among the different arguments.The most remarkable work in this direction is the reranking approach by Toutanova, Haghighi, and Manning in this issue.When training the ranker to select the best candidate solution they codify pattern features as strings containing the whole argument structure of the candidate.Several variations of this type of feature (with different degrees of generalization to avoid sparseness) allow them to signicantly increase the performance of the base system.Also related, Pradhan et al.(2005b) and Surdeanu et al.(2007) convert the condence scores of several base SRL systems into features for training a nal machine learningbased combination system.Surdeanu et al.(2007) develop a broad spectrum of features, with sentencebased information, describing the role played by the candidate argument in every solution proposed by the different base SRL systems. 
In 2007, the SemEval workshop presented participants with a formal preposition sense disambiguation task to encourage the development of systems for the disambiguation of preposition senses (Litkowski and Hargraves, 2007).

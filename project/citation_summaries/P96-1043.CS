2.1 Rule Extraction Phase In the initial learning technique (Mikheev, 1996) which ac(:ounted only tbr sitnl)le concatenative regularities a guessing rule was seen as a triph',: A = (S, I, H,) where S is the affix itself; I is the l'os-elass of words which should be looked llI) in the lexicon as main forms; R is the pos-elass which is assigned to unknown words if the rule is satisfied. 
Through an unsupervised process of rule acquisition, three complementary sets of wordguessing rules would be induced from a general purpose lexicon and a raw corpus: prefix morphological rules, suffix morphological rules and ending-guessing rules (Mikheev, A, 1996). 
Mikheev (Mikheev, 1996; Mikheev, 1997) uses a general purpose lexicon to learn affix and word ending information to be used in tagging unknown words. 
This is the reason why we try to avoid conventional guessing rules using word morphology features such as those proposed in Mikheev (1996) and Oflazer and T ur (1996). 
Using the technique described above and the lexicon derived frora the Brown Corpus we extracted prefix morphological rules (no alterations), suffix morphological rules without alterations and ending guessing rules, exactly as it was done in (Mikheev, 1996).

379 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 3 A minimal requirement for building a Chinese word segmenter is obviously a dictionary; furthermore, as has been argued persuasively by Fung and Wu (1994), one will perform much better at segmenting text by using a dictionary constructed with text of the same genre as the text to be segmented. 
The agreement between multiple human subjects is even lower (Wu and Fung, 1994). 
The translation lexicon was automatically learned from the same corpus via statistical sentence alignment (Wu 1994) and statistical Chinese word and collocation extraction (Fung & Wu 1994; Wu & Fung 1994), followed by an EM word-translation learning procedure (Wu & Xia 1994). 
1 Introduction Parallel corpora have been shown to provide an extremely rich source of constraints for statistical analysis (e.g. , Brown et al. 1990; Gale & Church 1991; Gale et al. 1992; Church 1993; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan et al. 1993; Dagan & Church 1994; Fung & Church 1994; Wu & Xia 1994; Fung & McKeown 1994). 
Wu and Fung (1994) demonstrate that segmentation accuracy is significantly higher when the lexicon is constructed using the same type of corpus as the corpus on which it is tested.

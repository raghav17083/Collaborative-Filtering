Even if speaker mentions are not annotated (as in System A), it is still beneficial to make use of it, e.g., by first identifying them automatically as in System B. 4 Related Work There is a large body of literature for coreference resolution based on machine learning (Kehler, 1997; Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Yang et al., 2008; Luo et al., 2004) approach. 
Similarly, Kehler (1997) used maximum entropy modeling to assign a probability distribution to alternative sets of coreference relationships among noun phrase entity templates, whereas we used decision tree learning.

Other milestones of recent research include the deployment of probabilistic and machine learning techniques (Aone and Bennett 1995; Kehler 1997; Ge, Hale, and Charniak 1998; Cardie and Wagstaff 1999; the continuing interest in centering, used either in original or in revised form (Abra~os and Lopes 1994; Strube and Hahn 1996; Hahn and Strube 1997; Tetreault 1999); and proposals related to the evaluation methodology in anaphora resolution (Mitkov 1998a, 2001b). 
Kehler used Maximum Entropy to assign a probability distribution over possible noun phrase coreference relationships (1997).

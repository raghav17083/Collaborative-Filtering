While manual classification of large numbers of words has proved difficult and time-consuming, recent research shows that it is possible to automatically induce lexical classes from corpus data with promising accuracy (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Korhonen et al. , 2003). 
Spectral clustering has been shown to be effective for high dimensional and non-convex data in NLP (Chen et al., 2006) and it has been applied to German verb clustering by Brew and Schulte im Walde (2002). 
In recent years several attempts have been made to automatically induce semantic verb classes from (mainly) syntactic information in corpus data (Joanis, 2002; Merlo et al. , 2002; Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002). 
8 Related work Previous work on unsupervised verb clustering used algorithms that require the number of clusters as input e.g. PC, Information Bottleneck (Korhonen et al., 2006b) and spectral clustering (Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002). 
Some experiments have been reported recently which indicate that it should be possible, in the future, to automatically supplement extant classi cations with novel verb classes and member verbs from corpus data (Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Korhonen et al. , 2003).

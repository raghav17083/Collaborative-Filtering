An alternative solution for enhancing the translation model is through self-training (Ueffing, 2006; Ueffing et al., 2007) which re-trains the source-target N-best hypotheses together with the original training data, and thus differs from ours in the way of new phrase pairs extraction. 
(Ueffing et al., 2007; Haffari et al., 2009) show that treating U+ as a source for a new feature function in a loglinear model for SMT (Och and Ney, 2004) allows us to maximally take advantage of unlabeled data by finding a weight for this feature using minimum error-rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003). 
Transductive learning method (Ueffing et al., 2007) which repeatedly re-trains the generated sourcetarget N-best hypotheses with the original training data again showed translation performance improvement and demonstrated that the translation model can be reinforced from N-best hypotheses. 
Also, this method has been shown empirically to be more effective (Ueffing et al., 2007b) than (1) using the weighted combination of the two phrase tables from L and U+, or (2) combining the two sets of data and training from the bitext LU+. 
The d een our method and that in (Ueffing et al., 2007) is that we translate a larger in-domain source corpus, and we use 1-best translation  5  We use the method described in (Koehn and Monz, 2006) for significance test.

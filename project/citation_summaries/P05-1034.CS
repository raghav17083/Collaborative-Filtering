2.1 Obtaining Target Dependency Trees Through Projection Our algorithm for obtaining target dependency trees by projection of the source trees via the word alignment is the one used in the MT system of (Quirk et al. , 2005). 
One of the theoretical problems with phrase based SMT models is that they can not effectively model the discontiguous translations and numerous attempts have been made on this issue (Simard et al., 2005; Quirk and Menezes, 2006; Wellington et al., 2006; Bod, 2007; Zhang et al., 2007). 
One is machine translation, where programs extract translation rules from word-aligned corpora (Och and Ney, 2004; Galley et al., 2004; Chiang, 2007; Quirk et al., 2005). 
Quirk et al 2005 demonstrates the success of using fragments of a target languages grammar, what they call treelets, to improve performance in phrasal translation. 
2 Related Work There have been various efforts to integrate linguistic knowledge into SMT systems, either from the target side (Marcu et al., 2006; Hassan et al., 2007; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006), the source side (Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006) or both sides (Eisner, 2003; Ding et al., 2005; Koehn and Hoang, 2007), just to name a few.

Several methods have been proposed with regard to aligning sentences (Brown et al. , 1991; Gale and Church, 1991; Haruno and Yamazaki, 1996; Kay and l~osche/sen, 1993), alJs~nlng words (Church, 1993; Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al. , 1993; Wu, 1995; Yamada et al. , 1996) and acquiring rules from bilingual corpora (Dagan et al. , 1991; Dagan and Church, 1994; Fung and Church, 1994; Tana~, 1994; Yamada et al. , 1995). 
1 Introduction Despite a surge in research using parallel corpora for various machine translation tasks (Brown et al. 1993),(Brown et al. 1991; Gale & Church 1993; Church 1993; Dagan & Church 1994; Simard et al. 1992; Chen 1993; Melamed 1995; Wu & Xia 1994; Wu 1994; Smadja et aI. 
(Dagan and Church, 1994), accept sequencies of nouns, which give them high precision, but not such a good recall as that of (Justeson and Katz, 1995), which allow some prepositions (i.e. oj~ to be part of the extracted candidate terms. 
Most of the research has focused on bilingual terminology identification, either as parallel multiwords forms (e.g. the ChampoUion system (Smadja et a1.1996)), technical terminology (e.g. the Termight system (Dagan and Church, 1994) or broad-coverage translation lexicons (e.g. the SABLE system (Resnik and Melamed, 1997)). 
Related Work The recent availability of large amounts of bilingual data has attracted interest in several areas, including sentence alignment (Gale and Church 1991b; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Simard, Foster and Isabelle 1992; Gale and Church 1993; Chen 1993), word alignment (Gale and Church 1991a; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994; Fung 1995b), alignment of groups of words (Smadja 1992; Kupiec 1993; van der Eijk 1993), and statistical translation (Brown et al. 1993).

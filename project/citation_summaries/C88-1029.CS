The order in which the elements of a CI must be synthesized is determined by "non-local dependencies" and "cross dependencies" (L.Danlos & F.Namer 1988, L.Danlos 1988).


For example, Danlos and Namer (1988) point out that in French, whether a pronoun unambiguously refers to an entity depends on word ordering.

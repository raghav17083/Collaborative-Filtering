Attempting to answer that question, van Halteren and Teufel (2003) conclude that 30 to 40 manual summaries should be sufficient to establish a stable consensus model summary. 
One of the issues studied since the inception of automatic summarization is that of human agreement: different people choose different content for their summaries (Rath et al., 1961; van Halteren and Teufel, 2003; Nenkova et al., 2007). 
Though we look at multidocument summaries rather than single document ones, SCU annotation otherwise resembles the annotation of factoids in (Halteren and Teufel, 2003); as they do with factoids, we find increasing numbers of SCUs as the pool of summaries grows. 
To some extent, the work described in this paper is close to that of (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) and (Van Halteren and Teufel, 2003). 
In their examination of summary evaluations, van Halteren and Teufel (2003) suggest that it is necessary to use at least 30 to 40 model summaries for a stable evaluation; however, Harman and Over (2004) argue that a stable evaluation can be conducted even with a single model, as long as there is an adequate number of topics.

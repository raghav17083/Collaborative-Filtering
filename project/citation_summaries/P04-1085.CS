The contrast classi er is also competitive with the best case result in (Galley et al. , 2004) (last entry), which adds speaker change, segment duration, and adjacency pair sequence dependency features using a dynamic Bayesian network. 
Previously researchers have focused on the interactive aspects of argumentative and decisionmaking dialogue, tackling issues such as the detection of agreement and disagreement and the level of emotional involvement of conversational participants (Hillard et al., 2003; Wrede and Shriberg, 2003; Galley et al., 2004; Gatica-Perez et al., 2005). 
3.2 Results First, we performed the same experiment as in (Hillard et al. , 2003) and (Galley et al. , 2004), using the contrast classi er (CC) method . Among the four meetings, the data from one meeting was set aside for testing. 
More sophisticated approaches have been proposed (Hillard et al. , 2003), including an extension that, in an interesting reversal of our problem, makes use of sentimentpolarity indicators within speech segments (Galley et al. , 2004). 
This recent research has tackled issues such as the automatic detection of agreement and disagreement (Hillard et al., 2003; Galley et al., 2004), and of the level of involvement of conversational participants (Wrede and Shriberg, 2003; Gatica-Perez et al., 2005).

Our approach also solves the problem noted by Bear (1988) of the overgenerality of rules in an FSM system. 
A similar point of view, that is attaching exception lists to general rules, may be found in (Bear,1988). 
Therefore some allomorphic rules 97r* denotes the Kleene closure over alphabet 11" and A the complement of A with respect to ~r. 144 are restricted in nonphonological ways, applying only to certain word classes, so that some stems admit idiosyncratic exceptions with respect to the applicability of rules (see Bear 1988, Emele 1988, Trost 1991) To overcome the first difficulty, a number of researchers have suggested augmenting FA with "word grammars", expressed in terms of feature formalisms like PATR II (Bear 1986) or HPSG (Trost 1990). 
Finally, having the level of properties over which to state generalizations means that our lexical representations of strings are not cluttered with non-realizable diacritic characters whose function is simply to trigger morphological processes (of Bear 1988). 
It has long been proposed that regular formalisms (e.g. , rewrite rules, two-level formalisms) accommodate rule features which provide for finer and more elegant descriptions (Bear, 1988).

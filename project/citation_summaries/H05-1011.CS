Much of the recent work in word alignment has focussed on improving the word alignment quality through better modeling (Och and Ney, 2003; Deng and Byrne, 2005; Martin et al. , 2005) or alternative approaches to training (Fraser and Marcu, 2006b; Moore, 2005; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005). 
LLR and CLP are the word association statistics used in Moores work (Moore, 2005). 
In general, Agold / Acandidates; following (Collins, 2000) and (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) for parse reranking and (Liang et al., 2006) for translation reranking, we define Aoracle as alignment in Acandidates that is most similar to Agold.8 We update each feature weight i as follows: i = i + hAoraclei hA1-besti .9 Following (Moore, 2005), after each training pass, we average all the feature weight vectors seen during the pass, and decode the discriminative training set using the vector of averaged feature weights. 
Examples of this perspective include (Liu et al. , 2005; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005; Moore, 2005; Taskar et al. , 2005). 
We use an online learning framework called MIRA (McDonald et al. , 2005; Crammer and Singer, 2003) for training a discriminative model for the word alignment task (Taskar et al. , 2005; Moore, 2005).

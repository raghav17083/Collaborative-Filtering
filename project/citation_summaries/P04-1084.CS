This is an important improvement over the result in (Melamed et al., 2004), as this quantity enters into the parsing complexity of both multitext grammars and LCFRS as an exponential factor, and therefore must be kept as low as possible to ensure practically viable parsing. 
It differs from the many approaches where (1) is defined by a stochastic synchronous grammar (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al. , 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Eisner, 2003; Gildea, 2003; Melamed, 2004) and from transfer-based systems defined by context-free grammars (Lavie et al. , 2003). 
(2004) call fanout.3 The least complex alignments on this measure  those that can be generated with zero gaps  are precisely those that can be generated by an 2If we imagine that each word is generated from a separate nonterminal as in GCNF (Melamed et al. , 2004), then constraint 2 becomes a special case of constraint 1. 
Inside-out alignments (Wu, 1997), such as the one in Example 1.3, cannot be induced by any of these theories; in fact, there seems to be no useful synchronous grammar formalisms available that handle inside-out alignments, with the possible exceptions of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars (Shieber and Schabes, 1990), Bertsch and Nederhof (2001) and generalized multitext grammars (Melamed et al., 2004), which are all way more complex than ITG, STSG and (2,2)-BRCG. 
Then, h(s)  h(s) + Lmax, s  S. This epsilon1-admissible heuristic (Ghallab and Allard, 1982) bounds our search error by Lmax.3 3 Bitext Parsing In bitext parsing, one jointly infers a synchronous phrase structure tree over a sentence ws and its translation wt (Melamed et al. , 2004; Wu, 1997).

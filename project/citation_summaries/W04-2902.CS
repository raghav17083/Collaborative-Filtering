Without having to estimate the number of mixture components, this model has been shown to match the best result from LDA on a document modeling task (Teh et al. , 2004). 
Compared with other types of audio data, lecture speech often exhibits a high degree of spontaneity and focuses on narrow topics with special terminologies (Glass et al., 2004). 
6.1 iCampus Corpus The iCampus corpus (Glass et al. , 2004) consists of about 169 hours of lecture materials: 20 Introduction to Computer Programming Lectures (21.7 hours), 35 Linear Algebra Lectures (27.7 hours), 35 Electro-magnetic Physics Lectures (29.1 hours), 79 Assorted MIT World seminars covering a wide variety of topics (89.9 hours). 
Hidden Markov Model with LDA (HMM-LDA) (Griffiths et al. , 2004) further extends this topic mixture model to separate syntactic words from content words whose distributions depend primarily on local context and document topic, respectively. 
Compared with other types of audio content, lecture speech often exhibits a high degree of spontaneity and focuses on narrow topics with specific terminology (Furui, 2003; Glass et al, 2004).

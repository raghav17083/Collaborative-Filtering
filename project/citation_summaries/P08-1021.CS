The use of the two types of evidence can be seen at work in the system described by Lee and Seneff (2008b): Verb phrases are parsed and their parse trees are examined. 
Lee and Seneff (2008a) analysed preposition errors made by Japanese learners of English and found that a greater proportion of errors in argument prepositional phrases (look at him) involved a deletion than those in adjunct PPs (came at night). 
Lee and Seneff (2008b) automatically introduce verb form errors (subject verb agreement errors, complementation errors and errors in a main verb after an auxiliary) into well83 formed text, parse the resulting text and examine the parse trees produced. 
More recently, data-driven approaches have gained popularity and been applied to article prediction in English (Knight and Chander 1994; Minnen et al, 2000; Turner and Charniak 2007), to an array of Japanese learners errors in English (Izumi et al, 2003), to verb errors (Lee and Seneff, 2008), and to article and preposition correction in texts written by non-native ELLs (Han et al, 2004, 2006; Nagata et al, 2005; Nagata et al, 2006; De Felice and Pulman, 2007; Chodorow et al, 2007; Gamon et al, 2008, 2009; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008a). 
Lee and Seneff (2008b) give the example I am preparing for the exam which has been annotated as erroneous because, given its context, it is clear that the person meant to write I am prepared for the exam.

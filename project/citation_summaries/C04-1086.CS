Some other approaches that use both source graphemes and phonemes were also reported with good performance (Oh and Choi, 2002; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Bilac and Tanaka, 2004). 
1)andkatakana-to191 English back-transliteration (e.g.,back into fedex) have also been studied extensively (Bilac and Tanaka, 2004; Brill et al., 2001; Knight and Graehl, 1998), as it is an essential component for machine translation. 
Compared with the previous work on katakanato-English transliteration, these accuracies do not look particularly high: both Knight and Graehl (1998) and Bilac and Tanaka (2004) report accuracies above 60% for 1-best transliteration. 
This latter case constitutes the problem of transliteration, which has been extensively studied in the context of machine translation (e.g. Knight and Graehl, 1998; Bilac and Tanaka, 2004; Brill et al., 2001). 
Methods can be classied into three main types: grapheme-based (Li et al., 2004); phoneme-based (Knight and Graehl, 1998); and combinations of both these methods( hybrid-model(Bilac and Tanaka, 2004) and correspondence-based model(Oh and Choi, 2002; Oh and Choi, 2005)).

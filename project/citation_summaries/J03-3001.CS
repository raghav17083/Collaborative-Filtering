In corpus linguistics building such megacorpora is beyond the scope of individual researchers, and they are not easily accessible (Kennedy, 1998: 56) unless the web is used as a corpus (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). 
In recent years, the Web has been increasingly used as a source of linguistic data (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). 
Since the Web represents by far the largest public repository for natural language texts, and since Web search engines such as Google offer simple access to pages where language material of a given orthographic, grammatical, or thematic kind is found, many recent experiments and technologies use the Web as a corpus (Kehoe and Renouf 2002; Morley, Renouf, and Kehoe 2003; Kilgarriff and Grefenstette 2003; Resnik and Smith 2003; Way and Gough 2003; Fletcher 2004b). 
4 Detection of MWEs and related constructions Recently, many researchers have started using the World Wide Web as an extremely large corpus, since, as pointed out by Grefenstette (1999), the Web is the largest data set available for NLP ((Grefenstette, 1999), (Keller et al. , 2002), (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003) and (Villavicencio, 2005)). 
1 Introduction The Web is a very rich source of linguistic data, and in the last few years it has been used intensively by linguists and language technologists for many tasks (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003).

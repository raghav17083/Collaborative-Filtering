 Choi 2000  Chois (2000) state-of-the-art approach to finding segment boundaries. 
In Section 3, we compare the segmentation performance of our lexical chaining algorithm with two other well known lexical cohesion based approaches to segmentation; namely TextTiling (Hearst 1997) and C99 (Choi 2000). 
This data was used by Choi (2000) to compare various domain-independent text segmentation systems.6 He evaluated a133a26a186a62a186 (Choi, 2000), TextTiling (Hearst, 1994), DotPlot (Reynar, 1998), and Segmenter (Kan et al. , 1998) by using the data and reported that a133a26a186a180a186 achieved the best performance among these systems. 
5.1.2 C99 corpus For English, we used the artificial corpus built by Choi (Choi, 2000) for comparing several segmentation systems. 
4.1 Components of LetSum Thematic segmentation for which we performed some experiments with two statistic segmenters: one described by Hearst for the TexTiling system (Hearst, 1994) and the C99 segmenter described by Choi (Choi, 2000), both of which apply a clustering function on a document to find classes divided by theme.

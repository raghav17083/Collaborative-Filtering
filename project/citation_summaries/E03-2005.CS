The system has been implemented as an extension to our Wysiwym library (Evans and Power, 2003), using a wide-coverage grammar based on the subcategorisation frames found in the XTAG (Doran et al. , 1994) categories, and deployed in the domain of medical informatics.


Elsewhere (Evans and Power, 2003) we have described a library package for developing Wysiwym applications.

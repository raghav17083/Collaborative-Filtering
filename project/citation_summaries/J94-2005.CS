7 Conclusions \e have shown how retrieving disl)laeed items directly, rather than t)ositing a trace of some kind and then eancellillg it against an appriate iteln when one turns up, can I)rovide treatlllellts of leftand right-extraposition which display the advantages that (Johnson and Kay, 1994) obtain for leftextraposition.


(Johnson and Kay, 1994) suggest using ~sponsors' in order to license the introduction of traces, where a st)onsor is some item of the required kind that has already 1)een found, and which is hence potentially going to cancel with the trace.

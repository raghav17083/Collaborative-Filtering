(Reape and Thompson 1988) also describes an algorithm for computing the resulting automaton.


Now, it has been shown elsewhere (Reape and Thompson 1988) that the transducer that would result is also describable in the formalism of finite state automata and that its number of states has a upper bound which is the square of the number of states in the base automaton.

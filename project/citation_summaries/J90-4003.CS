In addition, there are several approaches to non-projective dependency parsing that are still to be evaluated in the large (Covington, 1990; Kahane et al. , 1998; Duchier and Debusmann, 2001; Holan et al. , 2001; Hellwig, 2003). 
1 Introduction It is sometimes claimed that one of the advantages of dependency grammar over approaches based on constituency is that it allows a more adequate treatment of languages with variable word order, where discontinuous syntactic constructions are more common than in languages like English (Melcuk, 1988; Covington, 1990). 
Also, a number of parsers have been developed for some dependency frameworks (Covington 1990) (Kwon, Yoon 1991) (Sleator, Temperley 1993) (Hahn et al. 1994) (Lombardo, Lesmo 1996), including a stochastic treatment (Eisner 1996) and an object-oriented parallel parsing method (Neuhaus, Hahn 1996). 
Parsers and applications usually refer to grammars built around a core of dependency concepts, but there is a great variety in the description of syntactic constraints, from rules that are very similar to CFG productions (Gaifman 1965) to individual binary relations on words or syntactic categories (Covington 1990) (Sleator, Temperley 1993). 
A number of parsers have been developed for some dependency frameworks (Fraser 1989) (Covington 1990) (Kwon, Yoon 1991) (Sleator, Temperley 1993) (Hahn et al. 1994) (Lai, Huang 1995): however, no result of algorithmic efficiency has been published as far as we know.

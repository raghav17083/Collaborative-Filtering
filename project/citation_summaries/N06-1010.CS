Jiang and Zhai (2006) exploit the domain structure contained in the training examples to avoid over-fitting the training domains.


Other techniques have tried to quantify the generalizability of certain features across domains (Daume III and Marcu, 2006; Jiang and Zhai, 2006), or tried to exploit the common structure of related problems (Ben-David et al., 2007; Scholkopf et al., 2005).

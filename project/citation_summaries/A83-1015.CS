Ravin Parse Fitting and Prose Fixing In EPISTLE, (a) the core grammar consists at present of a set of about 300 syntax rules; (b) ambiguity is resolved by using a metric that ranks alternative parses (Heidorn 1982); and (c) parse failure is handled by the fitting procedure described here. 
This is not the only alternative in the face of failure to parse even with relaxation; Jensen and Heidorn (1983) present heuristics for what to pass to the semantic interpreter in this case, given bottom-up parsing. 
American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 9, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1983 153 K. Jensen, G.E. Heidorn, L.A. Miller, and Y. Ravin Parse Fitting and Prose Fixing Thanks to the flexibility of this approach, it is possible to check grammar within the smallest imaginable constituents (Figure 9) and in the largest imaginable (Figure 10). 
The EPISTLE project (Jensen and Heidorn 1983, Miller et al. 1981) employs this alternative for grammatical violations. 
Application area and responding to ill-formedness Ill-formedness processing has been examined in many ~pplication areas, including data base access (Hendrix, et al. , 1978), building a data base (Marsh, 1983), grammar checking (Jensen and Heidorn, 1983),.

949 Stage 2: Intermediate level concept collection: Going beyond (Kozareva et al., 2008), we next apply the Doubly-Anchored Pattern in the backward direction (DAP1), for any two seed terms representing basic-level concepts or instances: DAP1: <X> such as [SeedTerm1] and [SeedTerm2] which harvests a set of concepts, most of them intermediate between the basic level or instance and the initial higher-level seed. 
(Kozareva et al., 2008) proposed the use of a doubly-anchored hyponym pattern and a graph to represent the links between hyponym occurrences in these patterns. 
5.1 (Kozareva et al., 2008) Table 2 shows a comparison of our extraction performance to that of Kozareva (Kozareva et al., 2008). 
Stage 1: Basic-level/Instance concept collection: We use the Doubly-Anchored Pattern DAP developed in (Kozareva et al., 2008): DAP: [SeedTerm1] such as [SeedTerm2] and <X> which learns a list of basic-level concepts or instances (depending on whether SeedTerm2 expresses a basic-level concept or an instance).1 DAP is very reliable because it is instantiated with examples at both ends of the space to be filled (the higher-level (root) concept SeedTerm1 and a basiclevel term or instance (SeedTerm2)), which mutually disambiguate each other. 
Pattern quality control is also investigated by using WordNet (Girju et al., 2006), graph structures built among terms (Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Kozareva et al., 2008), and pattern clusters (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008).

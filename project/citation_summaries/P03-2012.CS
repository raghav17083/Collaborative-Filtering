Our chain-starting classifier is comparable  despite some differences4  to the detectors suggested by Ng and Cardie (2002), Uryupina (2003), and Poesio et al. 
We reexamine the literature on the topic in detail, and propose a revised algorithm, taking advantage of the improved DN detection techniques developed by Uryupina (2003). 
The resulting model is then applied to a test text to determine the 1While we train the anaphoricity model using the Ng and Cardie (2002a) feature set, it should be clear that any features that are useful for distinguishing anaphoric and non-anaphoric mentions can be used (e.g., those proposed by Uryupina (2003) and Elsner and Charniak (2007)). 
There has been recent interest in determining anaphoricity before performing anaphora resolution (Ng and Cardie, 2002; Uryupina, 2003), but results have not been entirely satisfactory. 
They use, for example, a relatively coarse-grained notion of semantic compatibility between a few high-level concepts in WordNet (Soon, Ng, and Lim 2001), or more detailed hyponymy and synonymy links between anaphor and antecedent head nouns (Vieira and Poesio 6 A two-stage process in which the first stage identifies anaphoricity of the NP and the second the antecedent for anaphoric NPs (Uryupina 2003; Ng 2004) can alleviate this problem.

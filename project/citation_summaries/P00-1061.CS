This was overcome by a probabilistic model which provides probabilities of discriminating a correct parse tree among candidates of parse trees in a log-linear model or maximum entropy model (Berger et al. , 1996) with many features for parse trees (Abney, 1997; Johnson et al. , 1999; Riezler et al. , 2000; Malouf and van Noord, 2004; Kaplan et al. , 2004; Miyao and Tsujii, 2005). 
Previous studies (Abney, 1997; Johnson et al. , 1999; Riezler et al. , 2000; Miyao et al. , 2003; Malouf and van Noord, 2004; Kaplan et al. , 2004; Miyao and Tsujii, 2005) defined a probabilistic model of unification-based grammars as a log-linear model or maximum entropy model (Berger et al. , 1996). 
We are generally interested in log-linear models for parsing (Riezler et al. , 2000) and other tasks.

The comparison-based setup of OT learning is closely related to discriminative learning approaches in probabilistic parsing (Johnson et al. , 1999; Riezler et al. , 2000; Riezler et al. , 2002),1 however the comparison of generation alternatives rather than parsing alternatives adds the possibility of systematically learning the basic language-specific grammatical principles (which in probabilistic parsing are typically fixed a priori, using either a treebankderived or a manually written grammar for the given a14 This work was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).

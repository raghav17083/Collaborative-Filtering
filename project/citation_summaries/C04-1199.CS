The use of machine learning techniques can be found in Miliaraki and Androutsopoulos (2004) and Androutsopoulos and Galanis (2005) They use similar patterns as (Joho and Sanderson, 2000) to construct training attributes. 
43 2 Related Work Definition extraction is an important NLP task, most frequently a subtask of terminology extraction (Pearson, 1996), the automatic creation of glossaries (Klavans and Muresan, 2000; Klavans and Muresan, 2001), question answering (Miliaraki and Androutsopoulos, 2004; Fahmi and Bouma, 2006), learning lexicalsemanticrelations(Malaiseetal. 
The patterns are those used by Joho and Sanderson (2000), and four more introduced in our previous work (Androutsopoulos and Galanis, 2005) and (Miliaraki and Androutsopoulos, 2004). 
Joho and Sanderson (2000) use the position of the sentences as one of their ranking criteria, while Miliaraki and Androutsopoulos (2004), Androutsopoulos and Galanis (2005) and BlairGoldensohn et al. 
In fact, in turns out that virtually all successful attempts at definition extraction that we are aware of build on worked-out deep linguistic approaches (Klavans and 48 Muresan, 2000; Fahmi and Bouma, 2006; Walter and Pinkal, 2006), some of them combining syntactic and semantic information (Miliaraki and Androutsopoulos, 2004; Walter and Pinkal, 2006).

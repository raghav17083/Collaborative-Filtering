Therefore, our methods analyze a sentence backwards as in Sekine (2000) and Kudo and Matsumoto (2000). 
This idea is sinfilar to that of Sekine (2000)'s study, which restricts the candidates to five, i)ut in his case, without a granmmr. 
The usage of these articles is the same as in (Uchimoto et al. , 1999; Sekine et al. , 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002). 
KM02 = Kudo and Matsumoto 2002 [9], KM00 = Kudo and Matsumoto 2000 [12], USI99 = Uchimoto et al. 1999 [4], Seki00 = Sekine 2000 [18], and Sass04 = Sassano 2004 [7].

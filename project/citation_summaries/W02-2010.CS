To facilitate comparison with other classifiers for this task, most reported results 3 The method of retaining only the boundaries and reclassifying the entities was shown to improve the performance of 11 of the 12 systems participating in the CoNLL-2002 shared tasks, in both languages (Florian, 2002b). 
1 Introduction Given the usefulness of Named Entities (NEs) in many natural language processing tasks, there has been a lot of work aimed at developing accurate named entity extractors (Borthwick, 1999; Velardi et al. , 2001; Arevalo et al. , 2002; Zhou and Su, 2002; Florian, 2002; Zhang and Johnson, 2003). 
1 Introduction This paper investigates the combination of a set of diverse statistical named entity classifiers, including a rule-based classifier  the transformation-based learning classifier (Brill, 1995; Florian and Ngai, 2001, henceforth fnTBL) with the forward-backward extension described in Florian (2002a), a hidden Markov model classifier (henceforth HMM), similar to the one described in Bikel et al. 
Florian (2002) employed three stacked learners for named entity recognition: transformation-based learning for obtaining base-level non-typed named entities, Snow for improving the quality of these entities and the forward-backward algorithm for nding categories for the named entities. 
The particular setup in which fnTBL is used in this work is described in Florian (2002a): in a first phase, TBL is used to identify the entity boundaries, followed by a sequence classification stage, where the entities identified at the first step are classified using internal and external clues3.

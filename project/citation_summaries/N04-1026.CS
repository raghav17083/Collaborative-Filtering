As discussed in (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2004), two annotators had previously labeled 453 turns in this corpus with the emotion annotation scheme discussed in Section 3, and performed a preliminary set of machine learning experiments (different from those reported above). 
In (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004), we discuss a scheme for manually annotating student turns in a human-human tutoring dialogue corpus for intuitively perceived emotions.2 These emotions are viewed along a linear scale, shown and de ned as follows: negative a12a14a13 neutral a13a16a15 positive. 
(Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004) further details our annotation scheme and discusses how it builds on related work. 
Prior to our study, the 453 student turns in these 10 dialogues were manually labeled by two annotators as either "Emotional" or "Non-Emotional" (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004). 
We have applied Wekas (Witten and Frank, 2000) AdaBoosts version of j48 decision trees (as used in Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2004) to the 140 unseen examples of the test set for generating the learning curve shown in figure 4.

While we have demonstrated exhaustive parsing efficiency, our model could be used with any of the efficient search best-first approaches documented in the literature, from those used in the Charniak parser (Charniak et al. , 1998; Blaheta and Charniak, 1999) to A parsing (Klein and Manning, 2003a). 
However, internalheuristicsoftheCharniak search, such as attention shifting (Blaheta and Charniak, 1999; Hall and Johnson, 2004), can make this accuracy/efficiency tradeoff somewhat difficult to interpret. 
2.1 nbest list reranking Much effort has been put forth in developing efficient probabilistic models for parsing strings (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998; Goldwater et al. , 1998; Blaheta and Charniak, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Charniak, 2001); an obvious solution to parsing wordlattices is to use nbest list reranking. 
By definition of 4 The notion of attention shifting is motivated by the work on parser FOM compensation presented in (Blaheta and Charniak, 1999). 
The Charniak parsing pipeline has been extensively studied over the past decade, with a number of papers focused on improving early stages of the pipeline (Charniak et al. , 1998; Caraballo and Charniak, 1998; Blaheta and Charniak, 1999; Hall and Johnson, 2004; Charniak et al. , 2006) as well as many focused on optimizing final parse accuracy (Charniak, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; McClosky et al. , 2006).

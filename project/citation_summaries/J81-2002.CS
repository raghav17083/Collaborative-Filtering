Many researchers have attempted several techniques to deal with extragrammatical sentences such as Augmented Transition Network(ATN) (Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1981), network-based semantic grammar (Hendrix, 1977), partial pattern matching (Hayes and Mouradian, 1981), conceptual case frame (Schank et al. , 1980), and multiple cooperating methods (Hayes and Carbonell, 1981).

This frees us from pre-specifying either all "correct" linguistic possibilities for constraint satisfaction at all levels of representation, or all possible errors or recognized omissions as in more flexible approaches (Hayes and Mouradian, 1981; Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1981; Lehnert, Dyer, Johnson, Yong, and Hurley, 1983; Weischeidel and Black, 1980).

Other researchers have attempted to deal with ungrammatical input through network-based semantic grammar techniques (Hendrix 1977), through extensions to pattern matching parsing in which partial pattern matching is allowed (Hayes and Mouradian 1981), through conceptual case frame instantiation (Dejong 1979, Schank, Lebowitz, and Birnbaum 1980), and through approaches involving multiple cooperating parsing strategies (Carbonell and Hayes 1984, Carbonell et al. 1983, Hayes and Carbonell 1981).

Previous studies have shown that automatic named entity recognition can be performed with a reasonable level of accuracy by using various machine learning models such as support vector machines (SVMs) or conditional random fields (CRFs) (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003; Settles, 2004; Okanohara et al., 2006). 
Current approaches on biomedical text mining (e.g., Srinivas et al., 2005; OKanohara et al., 2006) tend to address the tasks of named entity recognition or relation extraction, and our goal is more complex: to extract computational representations of the minimum information in a given experiment type.

of the previous studies (Kim et al. , 2004; Okanohara et al. , 2006; Tzong-Han Tsai et al. , 2006), features of shallow parsers had a large contribution to the performance. 
Recent work includes improved model variants (e.g. , Jiao et al. , 2006; Okanohara et al. , 2006) and applications such as web data extraction (Pinto et al. , 2003), scientific citation extraction (Peng and McCallum, 2004), and word alignment (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006).

Molphological description systems without lmge implementations (like the paradigmatic morphology of Calder (1989), or Paradigm Description Language of Anick and Artemieff(1992) are not listed here, because their importance is mainly theoretical (at least, for the time being). 
As shown by Siekmann (Calder 1989), string unification is decidable and has a finite number of substitutions if repeated variables are only permitted on one side of the equation. 
The defeasible constraints providing values for <psp_form> and <p_fin_form> in Verb 19 Blocking is a consequence of the architecture proposed by Calder (1989) and of the DATR language. 
4 Comparison with other Frameworks 4.1 Calder's Paradigmatic Morphology The approach described in this paper is directly inspired by Calder's paradigmatic approach (1989); however, there are major differences between the two approaches. 
CONCLUSION The PI approach to morphologically conditioned phonological and orthographic variation relates linguistically to word grammar (Hudson 1984), word syntax (Selkirk 1982) and to prosodic phonologies, and derives its computational features from DATR (Evans & Gazdar 1989); formally it relates closely to object-oriented morphology (Daelemans 1987), paradigmatic morphology (Calder 1989), and Bird's constraintbased phonology (1990).

Using dictionaries as network of lexical items or senses has been quite popular for word sense disambiguation (Veronis and Ide, 1990; H.Kozima and Furugori, 1993; Niwa and Nitta, 1994) before losing ground to statistical approaches, even though (Gaume et al. , 2004; Mihalcea et al. , 2004) tried a revival of such methods.

It is important to compare the generation strategy presented here with Semantic-head-driven generation \[Shieber et al. 1990, van Noord 1990\] which is a direct generation algorithm froni logical form encodings. 
Some of the recent resea~h in this area is reported in (Calder et al. , 1989; Dymetman and Isabelle, 1988; Dymetman et al. , 1990; Estival, 1990; Hasida and Isizaki, 1987; Ishizaki, 1990; Shieber, 1988; Shieber et al. , 1990; Strzalkowski, 1990a-c; Strzalkowski and Peng, 1990; van Noord, 1990; and Wedekind, 1988). 
Recent work on semantic-head-driven generation \[Shieber et al. 1990, Calder et al. 1989, Noord 1990, Russell et al. 1990\] provides a very promising step towards efficient, goal-directed reconstruction of LF that is espescially suited for lexicon-centered grammar formalisms such as IIPSG or UCG. 
Monotonicity of unification means that algorithms such as head-driven generation (Shieber et al 1990) can be applied to grammars developed for analysis. 
Our general method is to take as inputs to the process various communicative goals of the system, expressed as logical forms, and use them to construct a single new logical form to be input to Geminis Semantic Head-Driven Generation algorithm (Shieber et al. , 1990), which produces strings for Festival speech synthesis.

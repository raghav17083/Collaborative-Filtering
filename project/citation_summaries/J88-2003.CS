Knowledge of lexical aspect, e.g., (a)telicity, is therefore required for interpreting event sequences in discourse (Dowty, 1986; Moens and Steedman, 1988; Passoneau, 1988), interfacing to temporal databases (Androutsopoulos, 1996), processing temporal modifiers (Antonisse, 1994), describing allowable alternations and their semantic effects (Resnik, 1996; Tenny, 1994), and selecting tense and lexical items for natural language generation ((Dorr and Olsen, 1996; Klavans and Chodorow, 1992), cf. 
Moens and Steedman 1988). 
This table comes from Moens and Steedman (Moens and Steedman, 1988). 
Aspectual classification is necessary for interpreting temporal modifiers and assessing temporal entailments (Vendler, 1967; Dowty, 1979; Moens and Steedman, 1988; Dorr, 1992), and is therefore a necessary component for applications that perform certain natural language interpretation, natural language generation, summarization, information retrieval, and machine translation tasks.

It is of interest in its own right, because a sublanguage corpus, or one containing only a specific language variety, has very different characteristics to a general corpus (Biber, 1993), yet it is not obvious how a corpus's position on this scale can be assessed. 
Note that according to Biber (1990, 1993a) a text length of 1,000 words is adequate for representing the distributions of many core linguistic features of a stylistic category. 
Discriminant analysis has been employed by researchers in automatic text genre detection (Biber 1993b; Karlgren and Cutting 1994) since it offers a simple and robust solution despite the fact that it presupposes normal distributions of the discriminating variables. 
All calculations were based on Spearman's S, where D 2 denotes the sum of the squares of the differences between the ranks of each pair of word types, and N the number of ranked pairs: 6D 2 r= 1 N 3 N It is known that a sublanguage corpus can have very different characteristics to a general corpus (Biber, 1993), yet it is not obvious how the position on this scale of a given corpus can be assessed. 
Biber (1990, 1993a) claims that it is possible to represent the distributions of many core linguistic features of a stylistic category based on relatively few texts from each category (as few as 10 texts), but we were interested in exploring the way in which the identification error rate is affected by increasing the training data.

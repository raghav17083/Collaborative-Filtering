Recently, (Stetina and Nagao, 1997) have reported 88% accuracy by using a corpus-based model in conjunction with a semantic dictionary. 
The best published results over RRR are those of Stetina and Nagao (1997), who employ WordNet sense predictions from an unsupervised WSD method within a decision tree classier. 
The fact that the improvement is larger for PP attachment than for full parsing is suggestive of PP attachment being a parsing subtask where lexical semantic information is particularly important, supporting the ndings of Stetina and Nagao (1997) over a standalone PP attachment task. 
We describe the different classifiers below: cl base : the baseline described in Section 7.2 cl R1 : uses a maximum entropy model (Ratnaparkhi et al. , 1994) cl BR 5 : uses transformation-based learning (Brill and Resnik, 1994) cl CB : uses a backed-off model (Collins and Brooks, 1995) cl SN : induces a decision tree with a sense-tagged corpus, using a semantic dictionary (Stetina and Nagao, 1997) cl HR 6 : uses lexical preference (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) cl R2 : uses a heuristic extraction of unambiguous attachments (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) cl PL : uses the algorithm described in this paper Our classifier outperforms all previous unsupervised techniques and approaches the performance of supervised algorithm. 
Stetina and Makoto (1997) use a supervised method with a decision tree and WordNet classes to achieve 88.1% precision on the same test set.

Traditionally, there are mainly two mainstreams in the SLU researches: knowledge-based approaches, which are based on robust parsing or template matching techniques (Sneff, 1992; Dowding et al. , 1993; Ward and Issar, 1994); and data-driven approaches, which are generally based on stochastic models (Pieraccini and Levin, 1993; Miller et al. , 1995). 
Language understanding is performed by Phoenix, a robust semantic parser (Ward and Issar, 33 1994). 
Traditionally, most semantic parser systems have been built using hand-crafted semantic grammar rules and so-called robust parsing (Ward and Issar, 1996; Seneff, 1992; Dowding et al. , 1994) is used to handle the ill-formed user input in which word patterns corresponding to semantic tokens are used to fill slots in different semantic frames in parallel. 
The Phoenix parser (Ward and Issar, 1994) is in charge of natural language understanding. 
This mechanism is well-suited for SLU since the spoken utterance usually consists of several phrases and noises (restart, repeats and filled pauses, etc) are most often between them (Ward and Issar, 1994).

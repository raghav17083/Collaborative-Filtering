2.2 Maximum Entropy Models Maximum entropy (ME) models (Berger et al., 1996; Manning and Klein, 2003), also known as 928 log-linear and exponential learning models, provide a general purpose machine learning technique for classification and prediction which has been successfully applied to natural language processing including part of speech tagging, named entity recognition etc. Maximum entropy models can integrate features from many heterogeneous information sources for classification. 
We used the implementation of MaxEnt classifier described in (Manning and Klein, 2003). 
Collins head words finder rules have been modified to extract semantic head word (Klein and Manning, 2003).

As machine learners we used SVM-light1 (Joachims, 1998) and the MaxEnt decider from the Stanford Classifier2 (Manning and Klein, 2003).

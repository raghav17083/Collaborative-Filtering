We use the finite-state parses of FaSTU$ (Appelt et al. , 1993) for recognizing these entities, but the method extends to any basic phrasal parser 4. 
To evaluate this methodology of deriving metonymic coercions, a test set of 20 New York Times articles were parsed by FASTUS (Appelt et al. , 1993) and used in conjunction with their coreference keys, as provided by the MUC test data. 
We have developed the underlying infrastructure required to make this possibility a reality, and we now have the capabilit y to begin experimenting with strategies for specifying patterns, and learning patterns from examples . The other area of research suggested by our serendipitous bug is to investigate more principle d means for combining the results of low-recall high-precision analysis, and high-recall low-precisio n analysis . Our experience in this evaluation suggests that there may be strategies based on partial information, and textual proximity that yield promising results, particularly for applications i n which some sacrifice of precision for increased recall is reasonable .

The first one makes use of the advances in the parsing technology or on the availability of large parsed corpora (e.g. Trcebank (Marcus et al.1993)) to produce algorithms inspired by Hobbs' baseline method (Hobbs, 1978). 
This knowledge is represented in axiomatic form, using the notation proposed in (Hobbs et al. , 1993) and previously implemented in TACITUS.

Currently, there are no parsers trained on the Penn Treebank that use the structure of the treebank in full and that are thus 1Some notable exceptions are the CCG parser described in (Hockenmaier, 2003), which incorporates non-local dependencies into the parsers statistical model, and the parser of Collins (1999), which uses WH traces and argument/modifier distinctions. 
Several studies proposed the use of deep linguistic features, such as predicate-argument relations output by a CCG parser (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003) and derivation trees output by an LTAG parser (Chen and Rambow, 2003). 
This evaluation scheme was the same as used in previous evaluations of lexicalized grammars (Hockenmaier, 2003; Clark and Curran, 2004; Miyao and Tsujii, 2005). 
The results show that each additional feature type increases perforLP LR UP UR cat Clark et al. 2002 81.9 81.8 90.1 89.9 90.3 Hockenmaier 2003 84.3 84.6 91.8 92.2 92.2 Log-linear 86.6 86.3 92.5 92.1 93.6 Hockenmaier(POS) 83.1 83.5 91.1 91.5 91.5 Log-linear (POS) 84.8 84.5 91.4 91.0 92.5 Table 3: Results on the test set mance. 
Hockenmaier (2003) proposed a consistent generative model of predicateargument structures.

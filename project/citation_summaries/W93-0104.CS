Most proper name recognizers that have been reported on in print either take as input text tagged by part-of-speech (e.g. , the systems of (Paik et al. 1993) and (Mani et al. 1993)) or perform syntactic and/or morphological analysis on all words, including capitalized ones, that are part of candidate proper names (e.g. , (Coates-Stephens 1993) and (McDonald 1993)). 
The metrics used were recall (R), precision (P), and an averaging measure, P&R, defined as: P&R = 2*P*R/(P+R) (2) Obtained results for English compare to the English resuits of Rau (1992) and McDonald (1993). 
In addition, some researchers have explored the use of both local context surrounding the hypothesized proper nouns (McDonald 1993; Coates-Stephens 1991) and the larger discourse context (Mani et al. 1993) to improve the accuracy of proper noun extraction when large known-word lists are not available. 
Several (e.g. , (McDonald 1993), (Mani et al. 1993), (Paik et al. 1993) and (Cowie et al. 1992)) look in the local context of the candidate proper name for external information such as appositives (e.g. , in a sequence such as Robin Clark, presiden~ of Clark Co). 
The metrics used were recall (R), precision (P), and an averaging measure, P&R, defined as: P&R = 2*P*R/(P+R) (2) Obtained results for English compare to the English results of Rau (1992) and McDonald (1993).

Following Dang & Palmer (2005) and Kohomban & Lee (2005), Sanfilippo et al. 
Kohomban and Lee (2005) get good results on disambiguation of the SENSEVAL all-words tasks using the 25 unique beginners from the WordNet hierarchy for training a coarse-grained WSD system and then using a first sense heuristic (provided using the frequency 2Mihalcea and Moldovan group WordNet synonym sets (synsets) rather than word senses. 
Bayes (Soft Tag) 66.3 NB baseline 63.7 SMUaw (Mihalcea, 2002) 69.0 Simil-Prime (Kohomban and Lee, 2005) 66.4 Senseval-2 Best System 63.6 (CNTS-Antwerp (Hoste et al. , 2001)) Table 6: Results compared to previous best systems on Senseval-2 English all-words task. 
Following Dang & Palmer (2005) and Kohomban & Lee (2005), we use contextual, syntactic and semantic information to inform our word 1 http://www.cs.unt.edu/~rada/downloads.html. 
Measures of distance in the WordNet hierarchy such as JCN have been widely used for WSD (Patwardhan et al. , 2003) as well as the information contained in the structure of the hierarchy (Kohomban and Lee, 2005) which has been used for backing off when training a supervised system.

Recent studies into the use of supervised learningbased models for the named entity task have shown that models based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) (Bikel et al. , 1997), and decision trees (Sekine et al. , 1998), and maximum entropy (Borthwick et al. , 1998) are much more generalisable and adaptable to new classes of words than systems based on hand-built patterns (including wrappers) and domain specific heuristic rules such as (Herzig and Johns, 1997). 
Similar advances have been made in machine translation (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994), speech recognition (Fiscus, 1997) and named entity recognition (Borthwick et al. , 1998). 
Various supervised learning methods for Named Entity (NE) tasks were successfully applied and have shown reasonably satisfiable performance.((Zhou and Su, 2002)(Borthwick et al. , 1998)(Sassano and Utsuro, 2000)) However, most of these systems heavily rely on a tagged corpus for training. 
A wide variety of machine learning methods have been applied to this problem, including Hidden Markov Models (Bikel et al. 1997), Maximum Entropy methods (Borthwick et al. 1998, Chieu and Ng 2002), Decision Trees (Sekine et al. 1998), Conditional Random Fields (McCallum and Li 2003), Class-based Language Model (Sun et al. 2002), Agent-based Approach (Ye et al. 2002) and Support Vector Machines. 
Similar advances have been made in machine translation (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994), speech recognition (Fiscus, 1997), named entity recognition (Borthwick et al. , 1998), partial parsing (Inui and Inui, 2000), word sense disambiguation (Florian and Yarowsky, 2002) and question answering (Chu-Carroll et al. , 2003).

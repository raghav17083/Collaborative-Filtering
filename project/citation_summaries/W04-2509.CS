2 QACIAD and the previous study QACIAD was proposed by Kato et al. as a task of QAC, which is a series of challenges for evaluating QA technologies in Japanese (Kato et al.2004b). 
QACIAD (Question Answering Challenge for Information Access Dialogue) is an objective and quantitative evaluation framework to measure the abilities of QA systems used interactively to participate in dialogues for accessing information (Kato et al.2004a)(Kato et al.2006). 
Like the NTCIR4 QACIAD challenge (Kato et al. , 2004), the TREC 2004 QA track grouped questions into series, using the series as abstractions of information-seeking dialogues. 
For example, in the information browsing tasks in (Kato et al. , 2004), there is not a global topic encompassing the whole interaction, but the information needs of the user are given by the information he is encountering as the interaction proceeds, that is, he is browsing the information in a free way, without having particular goals or particular pieces of information he wants to obtain in mind. 
Kato et al. conducted an experiment for confirming the reality and appropriateness of QACIAD, in which subjects were presented various topics and were requested to write down series of questions in Japanese to elicit information for a report on that topic (Kato et al.2004a)(Kato et al.2006).

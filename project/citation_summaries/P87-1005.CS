Traditionally such semantic knowledge is handcrafted, though some software aids exist to enable greater productivity (Ayuso et al. , 1987; Bates, 1989; Grishman et al. , 1986; Weischedel, et al. , 1989). 
The recognized necessity to describe the concept lexicon prior to dealing with natural languages is a feature which clearly distinguishes our approach from Computational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1987 277 Sergei Nirenburg and Victor Raskin The Subworld Concept Lexicon and the Lexicon Management System other work on lexical aids (e.g. , Ahlswede 1985) and brings us closer to some non-NL work on knowledge acquisition (e.g. , Lenat et al. 1986). 
Traditionally such semantic knowledge is handcrafted, though some software aids exist to enable greater productivity (Ayuso et al. , 1987; Bates, 1989; Grishman et al. , 1986; Weischedel, et al. , 1989). 
The work in lexicon has centered on a) studies concerned with the utilization of conventional humanoriented dictionaries, newly available in machine-readable form, for computational tasks (e.g. , Amsler 1984a,b; Chodorow et al. 1985; Ahlswede 1985; Markowitz et al. 1986) improving the ancillary capabilities for lexicon systems, such as, for instance, morphological processors and descriptions (e.g. , Nirenburg and Ben Asher 1984; Byrd et al. 1986; Boguraev et al. 1987); c) hand-building of lexicons necessary for natural language systems, often with considerations about extensibility (e.g. , Zernik and Dyer 1985; Bessemer and Jacobs 1987). 
A number of separate functionalities included in this system have been developed and used either in commercial word processing software packages or in NLP projects (e.g. , the translator's tools described in Macklovitch, 1989, ; and the developer environments IRACQ (Ayuso et al. , 1987), LUKE (Wrobiewski and Rich, 1988) or ONTOS (Monarch and Nirenburg, 1989), among many others).

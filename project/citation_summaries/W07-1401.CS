6.2 Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) As a second application-oriented evaluation we measured the contributions of our (filtered) Wikipedia resource and WordNet to RTE inference (Giampiccolo et al., 2007). 
2.3 Textual Entailment and Entailment Rules Textual Entailment (TE) has recently become a prominent paradigm for modeling semantic inference, capturing the needs of a broad range of text understanding applications (Giampiccolo et al., 2007). 
1see the reports on RTE-1 (Dagan et al., 2005), RTE-2 (Bar-Haim et al., 2006), RTE-3 (Giampiccolo et al., 2007), the RTE-3 PILOT (Voorhees, 2008), RTE-4 (Giampicolo et al., 2008), and RTE-5 (TAC, 2009) The problem of bias is quite general and widely known. 
Following common Textual Entailment terminology (Giampiccolo et al., 2007), we denote the target meaning by h (for hypothesis) and the given text by t. A typical applied inference operation is matching. 
Note that, although paraphrasing and textual entailment are sometimes used as synonyms, we use the former to refer to methods that generate or recognize semantically equivalent (or almost equivalent) phrases or patterns, whereas in textual entailment (Dagan et al., 2006; Bar-Haim et al., 2006; Giampiccolo et al., 2007) the expressions or patterns are not necessarily semantically equivalent; it suffices if one entails the other, even if the reverse direction does not hold.

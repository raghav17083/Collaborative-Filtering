In this respect, our program is similar to Zernik (1989) and Zernik and Jacobs (1990), working on extracting verb semantics from corpora using lexical categories. 
Recently, promising computational methods have been suggested \[Lesk, 1987; McDonald et al. , 1990; Wilks et al. , 1990; Zernik and Jacobs, 1990; Guthrie et al. , 1991; Hearst, 1991\] which attempt to use the local context of the word to be disambiguated together with information about each of its word senses to solve this problem. 
The use of such relations (mainly relations between verbs or nouns and their arguments and modifiers) for various purposes has received growing attention in recent research (Church and Hanks 1990; Zernik and Jacobs 1990; Hindle 1990; Smadja 1993).

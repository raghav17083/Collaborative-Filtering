The HMM/CFG composite model was evaluated in the ATIS domain (Price, 1990). 
However, we have been able to formulate PRECISEs constraint satisfaction problem as a graph matching problem that is solved in polynomial time by the MaxFlow algorithm: Theorem 2 For lexicon L, PRECISE finds one valid interpretation for a tokenization T of a semantically tractable question in time O(Mn2), where n is the number of tokens in T and M is the maximum number of interpretations that a token can have in L. 4 Experimental Evaluation Semantic Tractability (ST) theory and PRECISEs architecture raise a four empirical questions that we now address via experiments on the ATIS data set (Price, 1990): how prevalent are ST questions? 
Some of the previous work on semantic parsing has focused on fairly simple domains, primarily, ATIS (Air Travel Information Service) (Price, 1990)whosesemanticanalysisisequivalenttofilling a single semantic frame (Miller et al. , 1996; Popescu et al. , 2004). 
We introduce a theoretical framework for discriminating between Semantically Tractable (ST) questions and difficult ones, and we show that ST questions are prevalent in the well-studied ATIS data set (Price, 1990). 
To evaluate our approach, we trained an experimental system using data from the Air Travel Information (ATIS) domain (Bates et al. 1990; Price 1990).

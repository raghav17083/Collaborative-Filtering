Extending a technique presented in (Klein and Manning, 2003) and adopted in (Merlo and Musillo, 2005) for function labels with stateof-the-art results, we split some part-of-speech tags into tags marked with AM-X semantic role labels. 
3 Learning Semantic Role Labels Previous work on learning function labels during parsing (Merlo and Musillo, 2005; Musillo and Merlo, 2005) assumed that function labels represent the interface between lexical semantics and syntax. 
For more information on this technique to capture domains induced by the c-command relation, see (Musillo and Merlo, 2005).

The two existing systems that use function labels sucessfully, either inherit Collins modelling of the notion of complement (Gabbard, Kulick and Marcus, 2006) or model function labels directly (Musillo and Merlo, 2005).

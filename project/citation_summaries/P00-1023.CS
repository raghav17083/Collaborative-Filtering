Morton (2000) also uses a maximum entropy mention-pair model, and a special dummy mention is used to model the event of starting a new entity. 
Using coreference information has been shown to be beneficial in a number of other tasks, including information extraction (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995), question answering (Morton, 2000) and summarization (Steinberger et al., 2007). 
Coreference resolution is a relatively well studied NLP problem (e.g. Morton (2000), Ng and Cardie (2002), Iida et al. 
However, (Morton, 2000) only attempts to resolve singular pronouns, and there is no mention of what percentage of total pronouns are covered by this restriction. 
1 Introduction Coreference resolution, the task of grouping mentions in a text that refer to the same referent in the real world, has been shown to be beneficial for a number of higher-level tasks such as information extraction (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995), question answering (Morton, 2000) and summarisation (Steinberger et al. , 2005).

Dynamic Programming based search algorithms are being used in speech recognition (Jelinek, 1998; Ney et al. , 1992) as well as in statistical machine translation (Tillmann et al. , 1997; Niessen et al. , 1998; Tillmann and Ney, 2003). 
If we assign a probability a15a17a16a19a18 a12 a13a7a21a20a4a6a5a7a23a22 to each pair of strings a18 a12a14a13a7a25a24 a4 a5a7 a22, then according to Bayes decision rule, we have to choose the target string that maximizes the product of the target language model a15a17a16a19a18 a12a14a13a7 a22 and the string translation model a15a17a16a19a18a26a4a6a5 a7 a20 a12 a13 a7 a22 . Many existing systems for statistical machine translation (Berger et al. , 1994; Wang and Waibel, 1997; Tillmann et al. , 1997; Nieen et al. , 1998) make use of a special way of structuring the string translation model like proposed by (Brown et al. , 1993): The correspondence between the words in the source and the target string is described by alignments that assign one target word position to each source word position. 
In section 2, we shortly review the single-word based approach described in (Tillmann et al. , 1997) with some recently iraplemented extensions allowing for one-to-many alignments. 
Pruning methods have already been used successfully in machine translation (Tillmann et al., 1997a). 
(Tillmann et al. , 1997) proposed a DP-based monotone search algorithm for SMT.

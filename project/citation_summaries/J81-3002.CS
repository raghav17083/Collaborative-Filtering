In many of the meaning representations used with logic grammars (Dahl (1981), for example), determiners provide the basic structure of the meaning representation formula. 
This is contrary to what seems to be the general tendency today, both in theoretical linguistics (for example, Gazdar 1981) and in computational linguistics (for example, Hirshman and Puder 1982, Joshi and Levy 1982, Robinson American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 9, Number 2, April-June 1983 79 Veronica Dahl and Michael C. McCord Treating Coordination in Logic Grammars 1982, Schubert and Pelletier 1982), towards using context-free grammars (which, however, are often augmented in some way through restrictions, local constraints, rule schemata, metarules, etc. compensating for the lack of expressiveness in simple contextfree grammars). 
The notion of modifier structure used here and the semantic interpretation component, which depends on it, are much the same as in previous work by McCord 70 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 9, Number 2, April-June 1983 Veronica Dahl and Michael C. McCord Treating Coordination in Logic Grammars (1982, 1981), especially the latter paper. 
The first sizable application of logic grammars was a Spanish/French-consultable data base system by Dahl (1977, 1981), which was later adapted to Portuguese l Visiting in the Computer Science Department, University of Kentucky, during part of this research.

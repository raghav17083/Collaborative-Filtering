Most prior work has been done for Machine Translation (MT) (Knight & Leah, 97; Paola & Sanjeev, 2003; Knight & Stall, 1998) from English to other major languages of the world like Arabic, Chinese, etc. for cross-lingual information retrieval (Pirkola et al, 2003), for the development of multilingual resources (Yan et al, 2003; Kang & Kim, 2000) and for the development of crosslingual applications. 
7 We implemented KANG00 (Kang and Kim, 2000) and GOTO03 (Goto et al., 2003), and tested them with the same data as ours. 
Many researchers have developed machine transliteration systems that accept a source language term as input and then output its transliteration in a target language (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Goto et al., 2003; Grefenstette et al., 2004; Kang and Kim, 2000; Li et al., 2004; Meng et al., 2001; Oh and Choi, 2002; Oh et al., 2006; Qu and Grefenstette, 2004).

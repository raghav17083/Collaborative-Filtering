2 Related work Web counts have been used for selecting transliteration hypotheses in several previous work (AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002; Grefenstette et al., 2004; Oh et al., 2006; Qu and Grefenstette, 2004). 
Alternatively, (Qu and Grefenstette, 2004) applied language identification of name origins to select language-specific transliterations when back-transliterating Japanese names from English to Japanese. 
However, the trigram is defined as the joint probabil57   ity 12 () ii i pcc c  for 3-character 12ii i cc c   rather than the commonly used conditional probability 12 (| ) iii pc c c  . Therefore, the so-called trigram in Qu and Grefenstette (2004) is basically a substring unigram probability, which we refer to as the n-gram (n-character) sum model (SUM) in this paper. 
Unlike previous work (Qu and Grefenstette, 2004; Li et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007) where NOR was formulated with a generative model, we regard the NOR task as a classification problem. 
Some of these have used the Web to select machine-generated transliteration hypotheses and have obtained promising results (AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002; Grefenstette et al., 2004; Oh et al., 2006; Qu and Grefenstette, 2004).

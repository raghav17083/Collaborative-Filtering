Semantic constraints may be expressed in several formalisms, such as semantic nets (Bobrow and Webber 1980a,b; Sondheimer et al. 1984), first-order logic, and production rules (for example, PROLOG, Warren et al. 1977). 
Many researchers have attempted several techniques to deal with extragrammatical sentences such as Augmented Transition Network(ATN) (Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1981), network-based semantic grammar (Hendrix, 1977), partial pattern matching (Hayes and Mouradian, 1981), conceptual case frame (Schank et al. , 1980), and multiple cooperating methods (Hayes and Carbonell, 1981). 
Except for the one metarule regarding incorrect phrase ordering in Section 3.2.4, the semantic meta-rules themselves are independent of whether proposing a phrase for a given case in a frame is based on syntactic considerations or other criteria (for example, Schank et al. 1980). 
Other researchers have attempted to deal with ungrammatical input through network-based semantic grammar techniques (Hendrix 1977), through extensions to pattern matching parsing in which partial pattern matching is allowed (Hayes and Mouradian 1981), through conceptual case frame instantiation (Dejong 1979, Schank, Lebowitz, and Birnbaum 1980), and through approaches involving multiple cooperating parsing strategies (Carbonell and Hayes 1984, Carbonell et al. 1983, Hayes and Carbonell 1981). 
Empirical work on knowledge structures (Bobrow et al. 1977, Mark 1980, Robinson et al. 1980) and on mechanisms of focus (Grosz 1977, 1981) is relevant to a proper treatment of sublanguage specific features of discourse and semantic structure.

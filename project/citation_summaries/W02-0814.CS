In a previous experiment (Hoste et al. , 2002b) it was shown that building word experts for words that occur at least ten times in the training data, yield the best results. 
Cross-validation focused on local context as opposed to non-local context (e.g. keyword features), since a post-SENSEVAL-2 study described in (Hoste et al. , 2002b) indicated that for the Dutch data, WSD on local context, the immediate three left and right neighbouring words of the ambiguous words, yielded the best performance among all variants tested. 
For learning, we are using the Timbl memory based learning algorithm (Daelemans et al. , 2001), which was previously found useful for the task of word sense disambiguation (Hoste et al. , 2002), (Mihalcea, 2002). 
Subsequently, cross-validation experiments were performed to optimize the amount of local context around the ambiguous word, which had been set arbitrarily constant in previous studies (Veenstra et al. , 2000; Hendrickx and van den Bosch, 2002; Hoste et al. , 2002a).

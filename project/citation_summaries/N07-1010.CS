5.2.1 Sequence labeling using traditional classifiers One common approach to the CoRef problem processes the mentions sequentially and determine for each mention whether it should start a new entity or be linked to an existing mention (e.g., (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Luo, 2007)); that is, the approach makes a series of decisions, 8There are minor differences between the language ID and coreference resolution tasks.

For instance, when searching for the best partition of a set of mentions, Luo (2007) combines the probabilities returned by an anaphoricity model and a coreference model to score a coreference partition, such that a partition is penalized whenever an anaphoric mention is resolved.

It is worth noting, in particular, that Luo (2007), Denis and Baldridge (2007), and Finkel and Manning (2008) evaluate their approaches on true mentions extracted from the answer keys.

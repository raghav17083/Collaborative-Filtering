This restriction is necessary because the problem of optimizing many-to-many alignments 5 Our preliminary experiments with n-gram-based overlap measures, such as BLEU (Papineni et al. 2002) and ROUGE (Lin and Hovy 2003), show that these metrics do not correlate with human judgments on the fusion task, when tested against two reference outputs. 
2 NeATS NeATS (Lin and Hovy, 2002) is an extractionbased multi-document summarization system. 
These methods usually represent the documents as term-sentence matrices (where each row represents a sentence and each column represents a term) or graphs (where each node is a sentence and each edge represents the pairwise relationship among corresponding sentences), and ranks the sentences according to their scores calculated by a set of predefined features, such as term frequencyinverse sentence frequency (TF-ISF) (Radev et al., 2004; Lin and Hovy, 2002), sentence or term position (Yih et al., 2007), and number of keywords (Yih et al., 2007). 
5.1 Open Questions Algorithm: For open questions, we follow typical MDS procedure: topic identification, interpretation & fusion, and then summary generation (Hovy and Lin, 1999; Lin and Hovy, 2002).

The substitutions employed by the evaluation rule for scoping achieve a similar effect to the introduction and discharging of quantifier assumptions in Pereira's (1990) categorial semantics. 
In the categoriai semantic framework developed by Fernando Pereira (Pereira, 1990; Pereira and Pollack, 1991; Pereira, 1991), syntactic structures are directly associated with interpretations (or their types), and syntactic configurations license the combination of these interpretations in a semantic derivation. 
The relevant equivalence is: Pron-he-intra Rest(~=~)=>~(Ay.Pred(y, he)) ~ Rest(~)=~(Ay.Pred(y,y)) if binding_conditions_hold  This equivalence is doing essentially the same job as Pereira's pronoun abstraction schema in Pereira (1990). 
Approaches to Quantifier Scope in Computational Linguistics Many studies, such as Pereira (1990) and Park (1995), have dealt with the issue of scope generation from a computational perspective. 
RELATED APPROACHES Viewed from a slightly different perspective, monotonic interpretation has a number of points of contact with Pereira's categorial semantics (Pereira 1990).

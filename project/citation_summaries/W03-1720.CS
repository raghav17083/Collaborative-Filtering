They did not use some of the features we used like character types, and our method achieved higher accuracies compared to theirs on the AS, HK and PK corpora (Asahara et al. , 2003).


The tagging task can be solved by using general machine learning techniques such as maximum entropy (ME) models (Xue, 2003) and support vector machines (Yoshida et al. , 2003; Asahara et al. , 2003).

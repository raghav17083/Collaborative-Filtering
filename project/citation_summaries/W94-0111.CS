12The mention encoding is the IOB2 encoding presented in (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) and introduced by (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1994) for the task of base noun phrase chunking. 
Among the machine learning algorithms studied, rule based systems have proven effective on many natural language processing tasks, including part-of-speech tagging (Brill, 1995; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1994), spelling correction (Mangu and Brill, 1997), word-sense disambiguation (Gale et al. , 1992), message understanding (Day et al. , 1997), discourse tagging (Samuel et al. , 1998), accent restoration (Yarowsky, 1994), prepositional-phrase attachment (Brill and Resnik, 1994) and base noun phrase identification (Ramshaw and Marcus, In Press; Cardie and Pierce, 1998; Veenstra, 1998; Argamon et al. , 1998). 
5 For a discussion of other issues regarding these two learning algorithms, see Ramshaw and Marcus (1994). 
Similarly to classical NLP tasks such as base noun phrase chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1994), text chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) or named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002), we formulate the mention detection problem as a classification problem, by assigning to each token in the text a label, indicating whether it starts a specific mention, is inside a specific mention, or is outside any mentions. 
Transformation-based error-driven learning has been applied to a number of natural language problems, including part of speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation, speech generation and syntactic parsing \[Brill, 1992; Brill, 1994; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1994; Roche and Schabes, 1995; Brill and Resnik, 1994; Huang et al. , 1994; Brill, 1993a; Brill, 1993b\].

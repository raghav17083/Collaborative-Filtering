Third, it has long been assumed (Lua 1997; Chen and Chen 2000) that the overwhelming majority of Chinese compounds are more or less endocentric, where the compounds denote a hyponym of the head component in the compound. 
According to Chen and Chen (2000), the three most dominant types of Chinese unknown words are: compound nouns (about 51%), compound verbs (about 34%), and proper names (about 15%). 
While contextual information is the primary source of information used in WSD research and has been used for acquiring semantic lexicons and classifying unknown words in other languages (e.g. , Roark and Charniak 1998; Ci190 aramita 2003; Curran 2005), it has been used in only one previous study on semantic classification of Chinese unknown words (Chen and Lin, 2000). 
Obviously this causes a great difficulty to an automatic task, especially to the example-based models which rely on the similarity measurement of the modifier morphemes to disambiguate the head senses (Chen and Chen, 1998, 2000). 
4.4 Circumventing Head-oriented Presupposition As remarked in Chen (2004), the previous research concerning the automatic semantic classification of Chinese compounds (Lua 1997; Chen and Chen 2000) presupposes the endocentric feature of compounds.

We introduce a new data-driven framework for dependency parsing that produces dependency DAGs directly from input strings, in a manner nearly as simple as other current transition-based dependency parsers (Nivre et al., 2007) produce dependency trees. 
Finally, the algorithm first described by Covington (2001) and used for data-driven parsing by Nivre (2007), is complete but has quadratic complexity even in the best case. 
Given that Slovene and Turkish have the smallest training data sets of all languages, this is consistent with previous studies showing that pseudo-projective parsing is sensitive to data sparseness (Nilsson, Nivre, and Hall 2007). 
However, despite rapid progress in the development of parsers for several languages (Nivre et al., 2007) and algorithms for more linguistically adequate non-projective structures (McDonald et al., 2005; Nivre and Nilsson, 2006), most of the current data-driven dependency parsing approaches are limited to producing only dependency trees, where each word has exactly one head. 
The parsing algorithms used are the arc-eager baseline algorithm, the arcstandard variant of the baseline algorithm, and the incremental, non-projective parsing algorithm first described by Covington (2001) and recently used for deterministic classifier-based parsing by Nivre (2007), all of which are available in MaltParser.

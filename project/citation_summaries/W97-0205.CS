Although the redundancy in WordNet could be a drawback, it can be an ideal resource for a broad-coverage domain-independent semantic lexicon based on underspecified semantic classes (Buitelaar, 1997, 1998). 
For example, Buitelaar (1997) notes that the noun book is assigned to seven different senses, including fact and section, subdivision. 
However, there has been recent work on WSD which has exploited generative lexicons (Pustejovsky 1995), in which related senses (i.e. , systematic polysemy, as opposed to homonymy) are not enumerated but rather are generated from rules that capture regularities in sense creation, as for metonymy, meronymy, etc. 13 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 As outlined in Buitelaar (1997), sense disambiguation in the generative context starts with a semantic tagging that points to a complex knowledge representation reflecting all of a word's systematically related senses, after which semantic processing may derive a discourse-dependent interpretation containing more precise sense information about the occurrence. 
4See (Santillippo, 1998) and (Buitelaar, 1997) for different computational treatments of tmderspecitied representations. 
However, Buitelaar (1997) describes means to automatically generate CORELEX entries from corpora in order to create domain-specific semantic lexicons, thus demonstrating the potential to access larger-scale resources of this kind.

The structural paraphrases produced by our algorithm are similar to the S-rules advocated by Katz and Levin for question answering (1988), except that our paraphrases are automatically generated.


(Katz and Levin, 1988; Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2001; Hermjakob et al. , 2002)).


In an early version of this system, such paraphrase rules  which included a combination of lexical and syntactic transformations  were created by hand (Katz and Levin, 1988).


In addition, similar semantic classes of verbs were used in natural language processing applications: START was the rst natural language question answering system to use such verb classes (Katz and Levin, 1988).


In order to solve this problem, START deploys "S-rules" (Katz and Levin, 1988), which are reversible syntactic/semantic transformational rules that render explicit the relationship between alternate realizations of the same meaning.

These rules may include long-distance dependencies not handled by HMM taggers, and can conveniently be expressed by the replace operator (Kaplan and Kay, 1994; Karttunen, 1995; Kempe and Karttunen, 1996). 
For the details of the formalism (briefly explained in the Appendix), please consult Karttunen (1995), Kempe and Karttunen (1996). 
Among others, it can be composed with transducers that encode:  correction rules for the most frequent tagging errors which are automatically generated (Brill, 1992; Roche and Schabes, 1995) or manually written (Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995), in order to significantly improve tagging accuracy -9 . These rules may include long-distance dependencies not handled by ttMM taggers, and can conveniently be expressed by the replace operator (Kaplan and Kay, 1994; Karttunen, 1995; Kempe and Karttunen, 1996). 
114 7 Appendix: Notational conventions The regular expression formalism used in this paper is essentially the same as in Kaplan and Kay (1994), in Karttunen (1995), and in Kempe and Karttunen (1996). 
1 Introduction Transducers compiled from simple replace expressions UPPER -> LOWER (Karttunen 1995, Kempe and Karttunen 1996) are generally nondeterministic in the sense that they may yield multiple results even if the lower language consists of a single string.

W04-1107:2	186:195	For chunking algorithm, many machine learning (ML) methods have been applied and got promising results after chunking is represented as tagging problem, such as: SVM (Kudoh and Matsumoto, 2001), Memory-based (Bosch and Buchholz, 2002), SNoW (Li and Roth), et al Some rule-base chunking (Kinyon, 2003) and combining rules with learning (Park and Zhang, 2003) are also reported.

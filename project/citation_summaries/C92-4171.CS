One further possibility is to choose a single syntax tree, and to use destructive tree operations later in the parse a. The approach which we will adopt here is based on Milward (1992, 1994). 
It can be used to specify the states of a left; to right parser and the possible mappings 10etween states, l"or example, Milward (:1992b) provides a dynamic description o\[' a shift reduce l)arscr, and a dynamic description of a fully incremental parser I)asod on dependency grammar. 
Verifying this would, for example, establish whether the copied strings need to be constituents, and this has a bearing on whether processing models designed for incremental interpretation (Milward, 1992) are the best descriptors of human performance". 
Some of the problelns with eategorial granlmar accounts of coordination do reoccur with a dynamic acconnt based on the parser used ill Milward (1992a).

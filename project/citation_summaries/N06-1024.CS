Machine learning methods were employed by (Higgins, 2003; Levy and Manning, 2004; Gabbard et al. , 2006). 
To expedite later stages of annotation, we have developed a parsing system (Gabbard et al. , 2006) that recovers both of these latter annotations, the first we know of. 
Note that Gabbard et al.s algorithm requires the use of function tags, which are produced using a modified version of the Bikel parser (Gabbard et al. , 2006) and a separate software tool (Blaheta, 2003) for the Charniak parser output. 
Three strategies have been proposed: (i) post-processing parser output with pattern matchers (Johnson, 2002), linguistic principles (Campbell, 2004) or machine learning methods (Higgins, 2003; Levy and Manning, 2004; Gabbard et al. , 2006) to recover empty nodes and identify their antecedents;1 (ii) integrating non-local dependency recovery into the parser by enriching a simple PCFG model with GPSG-style gap features (Collins, 1999; Schmid, 2006); (iii) pre-processing the input sentence with a finite-state trace tagger which detects empty nodes before parsing, and identify the antecedents on the parser output with the gap information (Dienes and Dubey, 2003a; Dienes and Dubey, 2003b). 
625 3 Evaluation 3.1 Setup We compare our algorithm under a variety of conditions to the work of (Johnson, 2002) and (Gabbard et al. , 2006).

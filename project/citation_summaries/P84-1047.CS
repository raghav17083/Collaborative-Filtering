Parsing and Interpretation The entity-oriented parsing of Hayes (1984) is proposed as a suitable technique for interfaces with restricted domains. 
Other researchers have attempted to deal with ungrammatical input through network-based semantic grammar techniques (Hendrix 1977), through extensions to pattern matching parsing in which partial pattern matching is allowed (Hayes and Mouradian 1981), through conceptual case frame instantiation (Dejong 1979, Schank, Lebowitz, and Birnbaum 1980), and through approaches involving multiple cooperating parsing strategies (Carbonell and Hayes 1984, Carbonell et al. 1983, Hayes and Carbonell 1981). 
(3) To ensure generality and in contrast to the entity-oriented parser of Hayes (1984), the grammatical knowledge is not exclusively tied to object type definitions but stored separately. 
Grammar based robustness tools have been explored in a variety of formalisms, e.g. the metarule device within the ATN formalism (Weischedel and Sondheimer 1898), entity data structures in a case frame approach (Hayes 1984) or the weak description approach in unification based grammars (Kudo et al. 1988, Goeser 1990). 
Hayes (1984) refers to the objects, events, commands, states (and so on) that an interface system needs to recognize collectively as "entitities ~.

In some work, context-free grammars are combined with scoring functions that are not strictly probabilistic (Nakagawa 1987), or they are used with context-sensitive and/or semantic probabilities (Magerman and Marcus 1991; Magerman and Weir 1992; Jones and Eisner 1992; Briscoe and Carroll 1993). 
In general our approach corresponds to making the probability of rule application conditional on other rules having applied during the parse derivation (e.g. Magerman and Marcus 1991) and the lexical category of the next word; for example, it would be possible to create a grammatical representation of the probabilistic model that emerges from a LR(0) table by assigning a set of probabilities associated with rule numbers to each right-hand side category in each rule of a CFG that would encode the probability of a rule being used to expand that category in that context. 
Chitrao & Grishman 1990; Magerman & Marcus 1991; Briscoe & Carroll 1993; Charniak 1996). 
Magerman and Marcus (1991) are interested primarily in scoring functions to guide a parser efficiently to the most promising parses. 
Probabilistic CFGs also will not model the context dependence of rule use; for example, an NP is more likely to be expanded as a pronoun in subject position than elsewhere (e.g. Magerman and Marcus 1991), but only one global probability can be associated with the relevant CF production.

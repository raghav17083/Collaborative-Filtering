Numerous researchers have proposed a variety of heuristics for recognizing abbreviation definitions, e.g., the use of initials, capitalizations, syllable boundaries, stop words, lengths of abbreviations, and co-occurrence statistics (Park and Byrd, 2001; Wren and Garner, 2002; Liu and Friedman, 2003; Okazaki and Ananiadou, 2006; Zhou et al., 2006; Jain et al., 2007). 
These include named relation extraction (Byrd and Ravin, 1999), custom dictionary building (Park, et al. , 2001), indexing for question answering (Prager et al. , 2000), cross-document coreference (Ravin and Kazi, 1999), and statistical collection analysis for document summarization or lexical navigation (Cooper and Byrd, 1997). 
A full form may appear min(m + 5,2m) words before its abbreviation in the same sentence, where m is the number of alphanumeric letters in the abbreviation (Park and Byrd, 2001). 
Since the late 1990s, researchers have presented various methods by which to extract abbreviation definitions that appear in actual texts (Taghva and Gilbreth, 1999; Park and Byrd, 2001; Wren and Garner, 2002; Schwartz and Hearst, 2003; Adar, 2004; Ao and Takagi, 2005). 
Other interesting work that addresses a similar task as ours includes the work on homophones (e.g., Lee and Chen (1997)), abbreviations with their definitions (e.g., Park and Byrd (2001)), abbreviations and acronyms in the medical domain (Pakhomov, 2002), and transliteration (e.g., (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Virga and Khudanpur, 2003; Li et al., 2004; Wu and Chang, 2007)).

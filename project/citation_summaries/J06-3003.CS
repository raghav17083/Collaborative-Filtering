Veale (2004) used WordNet to answer 374 multiple-choice SAT analogy questions, achieving an accuracy of 43%, but the best corpus-based approach attains an accuracy of 56% (Turney, 2006). 
In particular, we need to develop a backoff strategy for unseen pairs in the relational similarity tasks, that, following Turney (2006), could be based on constructing surrogate pairs of taxonomically similar words found in the CxLC space. 
 The automatically generated patterns in PairClass are slightly more general than the patterns of Turney (2006). 
One such relational reasoning task is the problem of compound noun interpretation, which has received a great deal of attention in recent years (Girju et al., 2005; Turney, 2006; Butnariu and Veale, 2008). 
Turney (2006) used a corpus-based algorithm.

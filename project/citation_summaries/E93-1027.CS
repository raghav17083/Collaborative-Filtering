It should be also noted that Kiyono and Tsujii (1993) exemplified the grammar extraction approach using offline parsing in the 3Although the size of the grammar becomes very large, the extracted rules can be found by a hash algorithm very efficiently.


2.2 Hypothesis Filtering The greater number of the hypotheses generated by the algorithm are linguistically unnatural, because the algorithm does not embody any linguistic principle to judge the appropriateness of hypotheses, and therefore we introduced a set of criteria to filter out unnatural hypotheses (Kiyono and Tsujii, 1993; Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994).


We have already proposed a mechanism which acquires sublanguage-specific linguistic knowledge from parsing failures and which can be used as a tool for linguistic knowledge customization (Kiyono and Tsujii, 1993; Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994).


Each new rule is annotated with the learning episode that gave rise to it, including end-user ID, time stamp, and a counter that will keep track of how many times the new rule fires in successful parses, s 3.2.2 Parser predictions As suggested by Kiyono and Tsujii (1993), one can make use of parse failures to acquire new knowledge, both about the nature of the unparsed words and about the inadequacy of the existing grammar rules.

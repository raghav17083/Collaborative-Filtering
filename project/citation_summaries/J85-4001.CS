Barton (1985) has shown that the ID/LP parsing problem is NP-complete (on the total problem size). 
Even worse, Barton1985) shows how the grammar expansion increases both the space and time costs of recognltlon, when compared to the cost of using the grammar directly. 
This version of the proof uses a slightly more complicated encoding of the vertex cover problem and resembles the proof by Barton (1985). 
It has been shown that parsing ID/LP rules is an NPcomplete problem (Barton 1985). 
It is adapted from a similar proof for unordered contextfree grammars (UCFGs) by Barton (1985).

We use this model because it was shown to be simple yet accurate (Ekbal et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007b).


We can mention a transliteration system for Bengali-English transliteration developed by Ekbal et al.(2006).


Few attempts are taken to build English to Indian language transliteration systems but the word agreement ratio (WAR) reached is upto 69.3% (Ekbal et al., 2006).

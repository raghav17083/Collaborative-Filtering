3 Standard Feature Set Our standard feature set is a combination of features proposed by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), (Surdeanu et al. , 2003; Pradhan et al. , 2004; Pradhan et al. , 2005b) and (Xue and Palmer, 2004). 
1 Introduction The release of semantically annotated corpora such as FrameNet (Baker et al. , 1998) and PropBank (Palmer et al. , 2003) has made it possible to develop high-accuracy statistical models for automated semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al. , 2004; Xue and Palmer, 2004). 
This is the feature introduced by (Xue and Palmer, 2004). 
First, in pruning, we use a deterministic preprocessing procedure introduced by Xue and Palmer (2004) to prune many constituents which are almost certainly not arguments. 
To represent the Fp,a pairs we used the following features: the Phrase Type, Predicate Word, Head Word, Governing Category, Position and Voice defined in (Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002); the Partial Path, Compressed Path, No Direction Path, Constituent Tree Distance, Head Word POS, First and Last Word/POS in Constituent, SubCategorization and Head Word of Prepositional Phrases proposed in (Pradhan et al. , 2005); and the Syntactic Frame designed in (Xue and Palmer, 2004).

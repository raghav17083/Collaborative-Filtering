MUC 3 evaluations), with one significant exception: while the MUC task was to fill in a template using potentially any amount of source text (Humphreys et al. , 1998), the framing is essentially an inverse process. 
In addition we intend to employ classic Information Extraction techniques (described below) such as named entity recognition (Humphreys et al. 1998) in order to pre-process the text, as the identification of complex terms such as proper names, dates, numbers, etc, allows to reduce data sparseness in learning (Ciravegna 2000). 
3 Coreference in LaSIE The LaSIE system (Gaizauskas et al., 1995) and (Humphreys et al., 1998), has been designed as a general purpose IE system which can conform to the MUC task specifications for named entity identification, coreference resolution, IE template clement and relation identification, and the construction of scenario-specific IE templates. 
Adapting the frames to WMD domain required only minimal modification, such as adding WEAPON entity to augment Identifinder entity set, specializing OBJECT attribute in WMDTransfer to WEAPON, generating a list of international weapon control treaties, etc. HITIQA frames define top-down constraints on how to interpret a given text passage, which is quite different from MUC 3 template filling task (Humphreys et al. , 1998). 
3.1 LaSIE In NAMIC, we have integrated a key part of the Information Extraction system called LaSIE (Large-scale Information Extraction system, (Humphreys et al. , 1998)).

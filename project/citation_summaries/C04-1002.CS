Most of the modern dependency parsers for Japanese require bunsetsu chunking (base phrase chunking) before dependency parsing (Sekine et al., 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002; Sassano, 2004).

The features used by Sassano (2004) are promising as well. 
Since our classifier is independent of individual parsing algorithms, we targeted speeding up (a classifier in) the shift-reduce parser proposed by Sassano (2004), which has been reported to be the most efficient for this task, with almost stateof-the-art accuracy (Iwatate et al., 2008).

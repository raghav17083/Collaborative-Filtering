1 SemEval-2007 included a task on semantic evaluation for English, combining word sense disambiguation and SRL based on PropBank (Pradhan et al.2007).Unlike the CoNLL tasks, this task concentrated on 50 selected verbs.Interestingly, the data was annotated using verb-independent roles using the PropBank/VerbNet mapping from Yi, Loper, and Palmer (2007).The two participating systems could predict VerbNet roles as accurately as PropBank verb-dependent roles.

5.5SRLonLanguagesOtherThanEnglish SemEval-2007 featured the rst evaluation exercise of SRL systems for languages other than English, namely for Spanish and Catalan (M`arquez et al.2007).The data was part of the CESS-ECE corpus, consisting of 100K tokens for each language.The semantic role annotations are similar to PropBank, in that role labels are specic to each verb, but also include a verb-independent thematic role label similar to the scheme proposed in VerbNet.The task consisted of assigning semantic class labels to target verbs, and identifying and labeling arguments of such verbs, in both cases using gold-standard syntax.Only two teams participated, with best results at 86% for disambiguating predicates, and at 83% for labeling arguments. 
With the advent of supporting resources, SRL has become a well-dened task with a substantial body of work and comparative evaluation (see, among others, Gildea and Jurafsky [2002], Surdeanu et al.[2003], Xue and Palmer [2004], Pradhan et al.[2005a], the CoNLL Shared Task in 2004 and 2005, and Senseval-3 and SemEval-2007).The identication of event frames may potentially benet many natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as information extraction (Surdeanu et al.2003), question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu 2004), summarization (Melli et al.2005), and machine translation (Boas 2002).Related work on classifying the semantic relations in noun phrases has also been encouraging for NLP tasks (Moldovan et al.2004; Rosario and Hearst 2004).

A number of equivalence relations between the classes of yield languages generated by fts' and other computational models have been established (Engelfriet 1991)(Engelfriet 1980)(Weir 1992).


Especially, it has been shown that the class of yield languages generated by finite-copying fts' equals to the class of languages generated by lcfrs' (Weir 1992), hence by mcfg's.


An equivalence relation *1 is shown in (Weir 1992).

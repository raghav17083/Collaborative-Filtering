(2006) and Foth and Menzel (2006) reported that accuracy was significantly improved by incorporating the supertagging probabilities into manually tuned Weighted CDG. 
Finally, the articles are parsed with the CDG dependency parser (Foth & Menzel, 2006). 
After all, the integration of the supertagging results helped to reach a quality level which compares favourably with the state-of-the-art in probabilistic dependency parsing for German as defined with 87.34%/90.38% labelled/unlabelled attachment accuracy on this years shared CoNLL task by (McDonald et al. , 2005) (see (Foth and Menzel, 2006) for a more detailed comparison). 
An interesting approach to the problem of parsing efficiency was using supertagging (Clark and Cur60 ran, 2004b; Clark and Curran, 2004a; Wang, 2003; Wang and Harper, 2004; Nasr and Rambow, 2004; Ninomiya et al. , 2006; Foth et al. , 2006; Foth and Menzel, 2006), which was originally developed for lexicalized tree adjoining grammars (LTAG) (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999). 
Finally, the biographies are parsed with the CDG dependency parser (Foth & Menzel, 2006).

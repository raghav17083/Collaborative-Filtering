As many other NLP areas, research in automated temporal reasoning has recently seen the emergence of machine learning approaches trying to overcome the difficulties of extending a language model to other languages (Carpenter, 2004; Ittycheriah et al. , 2003). 
The reader is referred to (Florian et al. , 2004; Ittycheriah et al. , 2003; Luo et al. , 2004) for more details of our mention detection and mention chaining modules. 
2.1 The Statistical Classifiers Good performance in many natural language processing tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, shallow parsing and named entity recognition, has been shown to depend heavily on integrating many sources of information (Zhang et al. , 2002; Jing et al. , 2003; Ittycheriah et al. , 2003). 
One common strategy shared by (Soon et al. , 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Ittycheriah et al. , 2003) is that a statistical model is trained to measure how likely a pair of mentions corefer; then a greedy procedure is followed to group mentions into entities. 
Early work of anaphora resolution focuses on finding antecedents of pronouns (Hobbs, 1976; Ge et al. , 1998; Mitkov, 1998), while recent advances (Soon et al. , 2001; Yang et al. , 2003; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Ittycheriah et al. , 2003) employ statistical machine learning methods and try to resolve reference among all kinds of noun phrases (NP), be it a name, nominal, or pronominal phrase  which is the scope of this paper as well.

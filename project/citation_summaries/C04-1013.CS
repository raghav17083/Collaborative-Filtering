(Clark and Thollard, 2004) argue for limiting the class of distributions to those defined by the probabilistic variants of the standard Chomsky representations.


All of the computational work that we are aware of makes these assumptions, whether in a nativist paradigm, (Niyogi and Berwick, 2000; Sakas and Fodor, 2001; Yang, 2002) or an empiricist one (Clark and Thollard, 2004).


This work can be extended to cyclic automata (Clark and Thollard, 2004a; Clark and Thollard, 2004b), and thus the class of all regular languages, with the addition of a further parameter which bounds the expected length of a string generated from any state.

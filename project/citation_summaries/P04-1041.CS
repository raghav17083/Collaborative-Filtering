Our approach is based on earlier work on LFG semantic form extraction (van Genabith et al. , 1999) and recent progress in automatically annotating the Penn-II treebank with LFG f-structures (Cahill et al. , 2004b). 
Our approach is to use finite-state approximations of long-distance dependencies, as they are described in (Schneider, 2003a) for Dependency Grammar (DG) and (Cahill et al. , 2004) for Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG). 
The f-structure annotation algorithm used for inducing LFG resources from the Penn-II treebank for English (Cahill et al. , 2004) uses configurational, categorial, function tag and trace information. 
Methods for doing so, for stochastic parser output, are described by Johnson (2002) and Cahill et al (2004). 
Our approach is based on earlier work on LFG semantic form extraction (van Genabith, Sadler, and Way 1999) and recent progress in automatically annotating the Penn-II and Penn-III Treebanks with LFG f-structures (Cahill et al. 2002; Cahill, McCarthy, et al. 2004).

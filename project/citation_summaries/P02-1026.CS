In our previous work (Genzel and Charniak, 2002) we propose that entropy rate is indeed constant in human communications. 
This result suggests intriguing connections with prior work on the relationship between entropy and discourse structure (e.g., Genzel and Charniak, 2002; Sporleder and Lapata, 2006). 
2 Within-Paragraph Effects 2.1 Implications of Entropy Rate Constancy Principle We have previously demonstrated (see Genzel and Charniak (2002) for detailed derivation) that the conditional entropy of the ith word in the sentence (Xi), given its local context Li (the preceding words in the same sentence) and global context Ci (the words in all preceding sentences) can be represented as H(Xi|Ci,Li) = H(Xi|Li)I(Xi,Ci|Li) where H(Xi|Li) is the conditional entropy of the ith word given local context, and I(Xi,Ci|Li) is the conditional mutual information between the ith word and out-of-sentence context, given the local context. 
Other researchers have observed relationships between discourse structure and entropy (e.g., Genzel and Charniak, 2002). 
We observe, however, that the effect is smaller than reported in our previous work (Genzel and Charniak, 2002) for Wall Street Journal articles.

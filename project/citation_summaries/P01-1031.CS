(b) If unsuccessful, B poses a Clarification Request (CR), that arises via utterance coercion (see (Ginzburg and Cooper, 2001)). 
However, in contrast to PGH, the overall approach is a different one: instead of explaining causes of CRs within a theoretic-semantic model (as the three different readings of Ginzburg and Cooper (2001) do), they infer the interpretation of the CR from the context. 
Finally, the evolving state of the linguistic context is a direct outgrowth of the linguistic forms interlocutors use and the linguistic relationships among successive utterances (Ginzburg and Cooper, 2001; Asher and Lascarides, 2003). 
2.2 Previous Analyses In a number of papers (Ginzburg and Cooper, 2001; Purver et al. , 2001), Jonathan Ginzburg and colleagues have developed an influential analysis of CR. 
1 Introduction Requesting clarification is a vital part of the com- municative process and has received attention from both the formal semantic (Ginzburg and Cooper, 2001; Ginzburg and Cooper, forthcoming) and con- versation analytic traditions (Schegloff, 1987), but little in the computational dialogue system commu- nity.

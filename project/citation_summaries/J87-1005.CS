The last takes account of the scope preferences of individual quantifiers, such as the fact that each tends to have wider scope than all other quantifiers (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987; Moran, 1988). 
Hobbs and Shieber (1987) pointed out that this is not so--it is essential to apply the quantifiers in a proper order. 
Adding appropriate side conditions to the rules, following the constraints discussed by Hobbs and Shieber (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987) would not be difficult. 
Alternatives that appear compatible with the present approach are quantitier movement (Hobbs & Shieber, 1987), type-ralsing at LF (Paxtee & Rooth, 1983), or the use of disambiguated quantifers in the derivation itself (Park, 1995). 
9 Treatments of quantifier scope in Montague grammar (Montague 1973; Dowty et al. 1981; Cooper 1983), transformational grammar (Reinhart 1983; May 1985; Heim 1982; Roberts 1987), and computational linguistics (Hobbs and Shieber 1987; Moran 1988; Alshawi et al. 1989) have depended implicitly or explicitly on a constraint on possible logical forms to explain why examples 1 such as 1.

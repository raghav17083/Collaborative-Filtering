If it does not exist in the full form lexicon, re-write rules (such as those described in Darwish (2002)) are applied, and the altered form is checked against the full form dictionary. 
Chew and Abdelali (2008) examine the use of a light stemmer for Arabic (Darwish 2002), and while this does result in a small overall increase in overall precision, there is paradoxically no increase for Arabic. 
(Darwish 2002) presents a supervised technique which identifies the root of an Arabic word by stripping away the prefix and the suffix of the word on the basis of manually acquired dictionary of word-root pairs and the likelihood that a prefix and a suffix would occur with the template from which the root is derived. 
If the simple form computed by the clitic stemmer does not exist in the general dictionary, re-write rules are applied (Darwish, 2002). 
The morphological dictionary is Buckwalters analyzer (version 2), made available by the LDC (Buckwalter, 2004).7 This analyzer has total coverage of the corpus; there are no 7Arabic morphological processing was also addressed by Kiraz (2000), who gives a detailed review of symbolic work in that area, and by Darwish (2002).

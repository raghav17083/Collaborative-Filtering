4.1 Unsupervised Learning Other work in automatic lexical semantic classification has taken an approach in which clustering over statistical features is used in the automatic formation of classes (Pereira et al. , 1993; Pereira et al. , 1997; Resnik, 1992). 
Class-based methods (Brown et al. , 1992; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee, 1993; Resnik, 1992) cluster words into classes of similar words, so that one can base the estimate of a word pair's probability on the averaged cooccurrence probability of the classes to which the two words belong. 
2 Related Work A large amount of previous research on clustering has been focused on how to find the best clusters [Brown et al. , 1992; Kneser and Ney, 1993; Yamamoto and Sagisaka, 1999; Ueberla, 1996; Pereira et al. , 1993; Bellegarda et al. , 1996; Bai et al. , 1998]. 
This can be done by smoothing the observed frequencies 7 (Church and Mercer 1993) or by class-based methods (Brown et al. 1991; Pereira and Tishby 1992; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Hirschman 1986; Resnik 1992; Brill et al. 1990; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993). 
Other works (Basili et al. ,1993a, 1996) demonstrated that a variety of lexical acquisition methods over small size corpora are viable whenever a domain specific semantic bias is available: using high level semantic classes (rather than simple words) increase the robustness of the probability driven methods, usually affected by coverage and data sparseness problems.

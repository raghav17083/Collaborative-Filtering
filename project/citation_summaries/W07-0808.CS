The KC tagset (Adler et al., 2008b; Netzer et al., 2007; Adler, 2007) takes a lexical approach to POS tagging (a word can assume only POS tags that would be assigned to it in a dictionary), while the TB takes a syntactic one (if the word in this particular positions functions as an Adverb, tag it as an Adverb, even though it is listed in the dictionary only as a Noun).

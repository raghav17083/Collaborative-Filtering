This may be done in a slmple, minded way as in PHLIQAI (Bronnenberg et al 1979) and T~ (Damerau 1980), or by providing hooks in the syntactic representation (domain-independent calls to semantic operators which will evaluate differently in dlferent contexts), as in DIALOGIC (Grosz et ai 1982).

Thus in systems of this by now conventional type, the 'portability' achieved by confining the necessary domain-dependent semantic processing to welldefined modules is purchased at the heavy price of limiting the early linguistic processing to syntax, and, perhaps, some very global and undiscriminating semantics (see for example the sccping algorithm of (Grosz et al 1982)). 
In interpreting degree questions, the languageprocessing component of TEAM \[Gzosz et al. , 1982a\], applies a hlgher-order degree operator to the predicate that underlies the adjective.

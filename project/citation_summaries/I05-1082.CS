Moreover, because the order of the semantic arguments in a nominal phrase or nounnoun compound is not xed (Girju et al.2005), the annotators were presented with the semantic argument frame for each of the 22 semantic relations and were asked to tag the instances accordingly.For example, in PARTWHOLE instances such as chair/Arg 1 arm/Arg 2 the part arm follows the whole chair, whereas in spoon/Arg 1 handle/Arg 2 the order is reversed.In the annotation process the translators also used the ve corresponding translations as additional information in selecting the semantic relation.For instance, the context provided by the Europarl English sentence in Example (3) does not give enough information for the disambiguation of the English nominal phrase judgment of the presidency, where the modier noun presidency can be either AGENT or THEME in relation to the nominalized noun head judgment.The annotators had to rely on the Romance translations in order to identify the correct meaning in context (THEME): valoracion sobre la Presidencia (Sp. Spanish), avis sur la presidence (Fr. French), giudizio sulla Presidenza (It. Italian), veredicto sobre a Presidencia (Port. Portuguese), evaluareaPresendintiei (Ro. Romanian). 
4.3 Learning Models Several learning models can be used to provide the discriminating function f.We have experimented with the support vector machines model and compared the results against two state-of-the-art models: semantic scattering, a supervised model described in Moldovan et al.(2004), Girju et al.(2005), and Moldovan and Badulescu (2005), and Lapata and Kellers Web-based unsupervised model (Lapata and Keller 2005). 
1.Introduction Prepositions are an important and frequently used category in both English and Romance languages.In a corpus study of one million English words, Fang (2000) shows that one in ten words is a preposition.Moreover, about 10% of the 175 most frequent words in a corpus of 20 million Spanish words were found to be prepositions (Almela et al.2005).Studies on language acquisition (Romaine 1995; Celce-Murcia and LarsenFreeman 1999) have shown that the acquisition and understanding of prepositions in languages such as English and Romance is a difcult task for native speakers, and even more difcult for second language learners.For example, together with articles, prepositions represent the primary source of grammatical errors for learners of English as a foreign language (Gocsik 2004). 
Previously proposed lexical models include the WordNet-based methods of Kim and Baldwin (2005) and Girju et al. 
4.2 Feature Space The set of features allows a supervised machine learning algorithm to induce a function that can be applied to accurately classify unseen instances.Based on the study of the instances and their semantic distribution presented in Section 3, we have identied and experimented with the following features presented subsequently for each language involved.Features F1F5 have been employed by us in our previous research (Moldovan et al.2004; Girju et al.2005; Girju, Badulescu, and Moldovan 2006).All the other features are novel.

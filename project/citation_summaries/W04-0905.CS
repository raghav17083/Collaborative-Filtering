Details of this approach to text processing can be found, e.g., in Nirenburg and Raskin 2004, Beale et al 2003, Nirenburg et al 2003a,b. The ontology itself, a brief ontology tutorial, and an extensive lexicon tutorial can be viewed at http://ilit.umbc.edu. 
The rationale behind these loops of correction and reevaluation is that low level mistakes like preprocessor errors or lack of coverage of some syntactic construction require different development action than more weighty (from our point of view) errors in semantic interpretation that might result from gaps in knowledge, insufficient reasoning engines, etc. The first experiment with our new evaluation regime produced the following results (reported on in detail in Nirenburg et al, 2004): the analyzer was shown to carry out word sense disambiguation at over 90% and semantic dependency determination at 87% on the basis of correct syntactic analysis and on sentences of an average length of over 25 words with 1.33 unknown words on average per input sentence.

In a recent evaluation, the basic analyzer was shown to carry out word sense disambiguation at over 90% and semantic dependency determination at 87% on the basis of correct syntactic analysis and on sentences of an average length of over 25 words with 1.33 unknown words on average per input sentence (see Nirenburg et al. , 2004). 
Semantic analysis in OntoSem is described in some detail in Nirenburg and Raskin 2004; Nirenburg et al. , 2004; Beale et al. 1995, 1996, 2003; Mahesh et al. 1997.

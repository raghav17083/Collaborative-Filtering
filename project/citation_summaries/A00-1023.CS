Assuming that it is very likely that the answer is a named entity, (Srihari and Li, 2000) describes a NE-supported Q&A system that functions quite well when the expected answer type is one of the categories covered by the NE recognizer. 
2 Question Answering Based on IE We use a QA system supported by increasingly sophisticated levels of IE [Srihari & Li 2000] [Li et al. 2002]. 
If the expected answer types are typical named entities, information extraction engines (Bikel et al. 1999, Srihari and Li 2000) are used to extract candidate answers. 
Examples of using NLP and IE in Question Answering include shallow parsing [Kupiec 1993] [Srihari & Li 2000], deep parsing [Li et al. 2002] [Litkowski 1999] [Voorhees 1999], and IE [Abney et al. 2000] [Srihari & Li 2000]. 
In response, factoid question answering systems have evolved into two types:  Use-Knowledge: extract query words from the input question, perform IR against the source corpus, possibly segment resulting documents, identify a set of segments containing likely answers, apply a set of heuristics that each consults a different source of knowledge to score each candidate, rank them, and select the best (Harabagiu et al. , 2001; Hovy et al. , 2001; Srihari and Li, 2000; Abney et al. , 2000).

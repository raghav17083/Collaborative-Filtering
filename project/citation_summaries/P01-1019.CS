We use Minimal Recursion Semantics (Copestake et al., 2001, 2005) as our semantic representation system. 
The grammar is couched in the theoretical framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard & Sag 1994), with semantic representations in Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al. 2001). 
An MRS consists of a multiset of elementary predications (eps), each of which is a single relation with its associated arguments, labeled by a handle; a set of handle constraints relating the labels of eps to argument positions within other eps; and a top handle indicating which of the labels has outermost scope (Copestake et al., 2001, 2005). 
Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al. , 1999; Copestake et al. , 2001) is a framework for computational semantics that is designed to simplify the work of algorithms which produce or use semantic representations. 
Thus for instance, (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000; Copestake et al. , 2001) describes a Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) which supports the parallel construction of a phrase structure (or derived) tree and of a semantic representation and (Dalrymple, 1999) show how to equip Lexical Functional grammar (LFG) with a glue semantics.

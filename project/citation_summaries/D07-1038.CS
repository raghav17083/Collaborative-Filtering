(May and Knight, 2007) use syntactic constraints to re-align a parallel corpus that has been aligned by GIZA++ as follows: they extract string-to-tree transducer rules from the corpus, the target parse trees, and the alignment; discard the initial alignment; use the extracted rules to construct a forest of possible string-to-tree derivations for each string/tree pair in the corpus; use EM to select the Viterbi derivation tree for each pair; and finally, induce a new alignment from the Viterbi derivations, using the re-aligned corpus to train a syntax-based MT system. 
May and Knight (2007) factorize the word alignment into a set of re-orderings represented by the TTS templates and build a hierarchical syntax-based word alignment model. 
For example, the word alignment computed by GIZA++ and used as a basis to extract the TTS templates in most SSMT systems has been observed to be a problem for SSMT (DeNero and Klein, 2007; May and Knight, 2007), due to the fact that the word-based alignment models are not aware of the syntactic structure of the sentences and could produce many syntax-violating word alignments. 
Approaches have been proposed recently towards getting better word alignment and thus better TTS templates, such as encoding syntactic structure information into the HMM-based word alignment model DeNero and Klein (2007), and build62 ing a syntax-based word alignment model May and Knight (2007) with TTS templates. 
(May and Knight, 2007) differs from our approach in two ways: first, the set of possible re-alignments they consider for each sentence pair is limited by the initial GIZA++ alignments seen over the training corpus, while we consider all alignments that can be reached by deleting links from the initial GIZA++ alignment for that sentence pair.

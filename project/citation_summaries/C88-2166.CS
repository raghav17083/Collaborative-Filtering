These problems have recently been the topic of intense research (Klavans 1988, Boguraev and Briscoe 1989, Boguraev et al. 1989, Zemick 1990).


Consequently, the integration of information from distinct MRD sources through simple word-sense matches is likely to fail in a significant number of instances (Calzolari & Picchi, 1986; Atkins 1987; Klavans 1988; Boguraev & Pustejovsky 1990).

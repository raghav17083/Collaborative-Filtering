The source sentences are tagged and segmented with CKIP Chinese word segmentation system (Ma and Chen, 2003). 
Conventionally, there are four approaches to develop a CWS: (1) Dictionary-based approach (Cheng et al. 1999), especial forward and backward maximum matching (Wong and Chan, 1996); (2) Linguistic approach based on syntaxsemantic knowledge (Chen et al. 2002); (3) Statistical approach based on statistical language model (SLM) (Sproat and Shih, 1990; Teahan et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2003); and (4) Hybrid approach trying to combine the benefits of dictionary-based, linguistic and statistical approaches (Tsai et al. 2003; Ma and Chen, 2003).

In (Bechet et al. , 2004) call center dialogs have been clustered to learn about dialog traces that are similar.


Such dialog systems are thus limited by the ability to parse semantic features such as predicates and to perform logical computation in the context of a specific dialog act (Bechet et al., 2004).


(Bechet et al., 2004) as: wMI(xi;yj) = p(xi;yj)log p(xi;yj)p(x i)p(yj) .

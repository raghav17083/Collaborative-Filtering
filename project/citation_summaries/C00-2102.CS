Various supervised learning methods for Named Entity (NE) tasks were successfully applied and have shown reasonably satisfiable performance.((Zhou and Su, 2002)(Borthwick et al. , 1998)(Sassano and Utsuro, 2000)) However, most of these systems heavily rely on a tagged corpus for training. 
Various machine learning approaches have been proposed for chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Tjong Kim Sang, 2000a; Tjong Kim Sang et al. , 2000; Tjong Kim Sang, 2000b; Sassano and Utsuro, 2000; van Halteren, 2000). 
Sassano and Utsuro(Sassano and Utsuro, 2000) introduce a variable context length model for Japanese named entity identification task and perform better results. 
Sassano and Utsuro evaluate how the difference of the chunk representation would affect the performance of the systems based on different machine learning algorithms(Sassano and Utsuro, 2000). 
In the training phase, this model considers which of the preceding/subsequent morphemes constitute one named entity together with the morpheme at the current position (Sassano and Utsuro, 2000).

Previous research on understanding intersentential ellipsis has emphasized syntactic and semantic strategies (Hendrix et al. 1978; Waltz 1978; Weischedel and Sondheimer 1982; Carbonell 1983), but the contributions of the speaker's plans and goals to the interpretation of ellipsis has hitherto been inadequately explored. 
Weischedel and Sondheimer (1982) describe an improved ellipsis processor. 
For this reason, ellipsis has received much attention and different solutions have been proposed based on the mechanism used to analyze the sentence: semantic grammars (the LIFER/LADDER system \[Hendrix, 1977\]), ATN \[Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1981, Weischedel and Sondheimer, 1982\], or caseframe instantiation (the XCALIBUR system \[Carbonell et al. , 1983\]). 
In Weischedel and Sondheimer (1982), we extended that heuristic to allow for turntaking in dialogues and to allow expansions as well as American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 9, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1983 171 Ralph M. Weischedel and Norman K. Sondheimer Meta-rules as a Basis for Processing Ill-Formed Input substitutions, such as the elliptical form "Last month" following "Did you go to Chicago"? 
Consequently, many relaxation strategies and systems in the literature (for example, Hendrix, et al. 1978; Kwasny and Sondheimer 1981; Weischedel and Sondheimer 1982) have been proposed and implemented in that framework.

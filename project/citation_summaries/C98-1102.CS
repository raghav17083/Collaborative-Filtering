Let y  Y(x) be a legal dependency tree for x; if the arc a = i,j  y, we refer to i as the parent of j (denoted i = pi(j)) and j as a child of i. We also say thatais projective (in the sense of Kahane et al., 1998) if any vertex k in the span of a is reachable from i (in other words, if for any k satisfying min(i,j) < k < max(i,j), there is a directed path iny fromitok).

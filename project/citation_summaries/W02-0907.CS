The goal of the work of Korhonen (2002a, 2002b) is to develop a semantically driven approach to subcategorization frame hypothesis selection that can be used to improve large-scale subcategorization frame acquisition. 
For the task of acquiring verb subcategorisation frames, we adapt to the speci cities of the Spanish language well-known techniques that have been developed for English, and our results compare favourably to the sate of the art results obtained for English (Korhonen, 2002b). 
We lter out the spurious patterns with a Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE), a method proposed by (Korhonen, 2002b) for this task. 
Our work confirms the results reported in Korhonen (2002a), which indicate that using word classes improves the extraction of subcategorization frames. 
In order to collect the frequency distributions of Spanish subcategorisation frames, we adapt a methodology that has been developed for English to the speci cities of the Spanish language ((Brent, 1993), (Manning, 1993), (Korhonen, 2002b)).

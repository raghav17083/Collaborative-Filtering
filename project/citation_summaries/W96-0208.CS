Many different learning approaches have been used, including neural networks (Leacock et al. , 1993), probabilistic algorithms (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994; Gale et al. , 1992a; Gale et al. , 1995; Leacock et al. , 1993; Yarowsky, 1992), decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994), exemplar-based learning algorithms (Cardie, 1993; Ng and Lee, 1996), etc. In particular, Mooney (1996) evaluated seven state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms on a common data set for disambiguating six senses of the word "line". 
This data has since been used in studies by (Mooney, 1996), (Towell and Voorhees, 1998), and (Leacock et al. , 1998). 
Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes is claimed to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy on supervised WSD in many papers (Mooney, 1996; Ng, 1997; Leacock et al. , 1998). 
They have a long history of use in word sense disambiguation, dating back to early work by (Black, 1988), and have fared well in comparative studies such as (Mooney, 1996) and (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997). 
The accuracy achieved by our improved exemplar-based classifier is comparable to the accuracy on the same data set obtained by the Naive-Bayes algorithm, which was reported in (Mooney, 1996) to have the highest disambiguation accuracy among seven state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

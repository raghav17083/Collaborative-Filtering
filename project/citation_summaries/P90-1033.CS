sublect relations lecogmzed m the LFTs by the predmatlve formula subjeCt(xl )&:verb(e, ~ l, ~.~) can be mapped into a x aIlet:y of thematic relations The defimtlon of the thematm relations is enurely based on mfo~matmn internal to the WordNet database, explessed as constraints Fol example, all the subjects of verbs that are hyponyms of the verb cause or have thts concept as the genus of then glosses are defined to represent the Iole of agents (2) The syntactzc obTect ~elatmns a~e tecogmzed m the LFTs b) the predmauve founula verb(em,xi,x2) & aoua(~2) The defimtmn of tim thematic relatmns

h~t a ball back and forth over a net that d~v~des a tennis court) Net semantm relauon holds between the arguments of a pteposmonal p~edmate, that specffic ~elatmn becomes the semantic transformauon of the predicate Fol example, the PP attachment \[sacrament of penance\] derived from the gloss of {confession} indicates a semantic kind-o\[ relauon due to the fact that m WordNet penance is a hyponym of sacrament (4) The transformation of complex nominal predzcates into thematic or semanUc constraints m done by first seeking a WordNet relatmn (or a combmaUon of such relatmns) between the components of the predicate If such a (chain of) relation(s) m found, predicate nn is transformed into the dominant WordNet semantic relation Otherwise, the no predicate is transformed into a thematic relation (5) The Uansformatlon of ad3ectwal and adverbzal adjuncts, lepresented m the LFTs as p~edmates sharing the same argument with the concepts they modify shall be connected to their modifiers through attribute lelauons 6 Include more derivational morphology Smce the oIgamzaUon of WordNet dlwdes the Enghsh vocabulary into four sepmate domains-nouns, velbs, ad\]ecuves, and adverbsclosely related concepts are often entered in more than one of these domains Many (probably most) of these relatmns can be ~dentffied m terms of denvatlonal morphology, e ~, the noun executzon is derived from the verb execute and so is an example of a deverbal noun WordNet already contmns some of th~s kind of denvatmnal morphology dead\]ecUval nouns are hnked to their root adjecuves (length m derived \[tom long), deadjectival adverbs are hnked to then loot adjecu~es (rapidly Is derived from rapid), and some denommal ad\]ecUves are hnked to then ~oot nouns (cellular m derived from cell) In o~del to mcrease the connecUwty of WordNet it would be desirable to include more such deIlvaUonal morphology Fol example, denvauonal lelatmns betxxeen nouns and verbs should be palUcularly useful (Hull and Gomez 1996) both de= veIbal nouns (avowal from avow) and denommal verbs (sammarlze from summary) Such connecuons would facilitate the recogmtmn that the same idea can be expressed m different ways, e g, that "He summarized the book" and "He gave a summary of the book" are effecUvel~ eqmvalent m meanmg Sometimes these morphological relations can be picked up from glosses, as when {disagreement} is defined as (the speech act of dlsagreexng or arguing or disputing), but these are generally regarded as unmformaUve definitions, and the leveIse relation may not happen to occur Since many of the words ale polysemous, moxphologmal relatmns should not link words, but synsets that have related meanings Fot example, {execute} meaning (to put to death) should be hnked to {execution} meaning (the act of puttxng a condemned person to death), and {execute} meanmg (to carry out a task) should be hnked to {execution} meaning (the act of doing sometMng successfully), etc And m cases where the concepts of the noun and verb a~e dlffeIent-e g, {womanize} floin {woman}-no semanUc link ~ould need to be cleated References H Alsha~xl Analysm the dlcUonaly deflmuons In B Boguraev and T Bnscoe,

These relations are then used for various tasks, ranging from the interpretation of a noun sequence (Vanderwende 1994) or a prepositional phrase (Ravin 1990), to resolving structural ambiguity (Jenson and Binot 1987), to merging dictionary senses for WSD (Dolan 1994).

catego~) that can be used to express the same meamng are grouped into a smgle synonym set, called synset Words wlth multiple meanings (polysemous) belong to multiple synsets An ~mportant part of the 99 643 synsets encoded m WordNet 1 6 contain word collocatmns, thus representing complex nominals (e g the synset {manufacturer, maker, manufacturing business}, (omplex velbals (eg the synset {leave

entries p~ov~des for their semantm mterp~etatmn Wolds and concepts are furthei connected through a small set of lexmo-semantm relatmns The dominant semantm relatmn is the hypernymy, xvh~ch structures

mformauon contained m glosses that now can be used only by humans to Iead the deflmtmn of synsets For example, Wo, dNet 1 6 hsts the concept {cat, true cat) with the gloss (fellne mammal usually havlng thlck soft fur and belng unable to roar, domestxc cats, wxldcats) Currently, from a concept like thin, only a few other concepts could be reached In Extended Wo2dNet, the concept {cat, true cat} will be,elated to 215othel concepts (I0 from its own gloss, 38 flom the glosses of its hypern>ms, 25 concepts that use ~t m the*r glosses as a defining concept plus other 142 concepts with which the concept mteracts in these 25 glosses) Thin level of mformatmn,s rich enough to presume that the Extended WordNet will work well as a knowledge base for common-sense reasoning 2 Related work

disambiguation of gloss concepts There are se~e, al dlffe~ences bet~een gloss dlsamblguauon and text dlsamb~guatmn A n-la\]oi difference is that m our project we know the meaning of each gloss, namely the synset to whmh a gloss apphes Second, the glosses contain a defimUon, comments, and one or more examples We address the word sense dmamblguaUon problem by using three complementary methods (a) heunstms, (b) conceptual dens,ty, and (c) staustins on large corpora The first two methods rely enurely on the mfolmaUon contained m WordNet, while the th,rd one uses other corpora Specffically, the sources of knowledge available to us me (1) lexlcal mformauon that includes part of speech, posluon of ~ords (1 e head word), and lexmal lelauons (2) collocauons and s)ntacuc patterns, (3) s}nset to which a gloss belongs, (4) hypernyms of s)nset and their glosses (5) synsets of pobsemouns x~o2ds and their glosses, (6) hypernyms of synsets of polysemous words, and their glosses, and so on Method 1 Classes of heur,st,cs for word sense dmarnblguatmn A statable techmque for dmamblguatmg dmuonarms is to rely on heu!mucs able to cope with d~ffe2ent sources of mformauon Work m tins alea w~ doue by Ravin (Rax m 1990) in a similar project at IBM, (Klavans et al 1990), and others We present no~ some of the heunsUcs used by us 1. 
At present all this information is collected and coded by hand, although recent work by Ravin (1990) and Dahlgren, McDowell, and Stabler (1989) suggests that the collection of role-related information may be automatable.

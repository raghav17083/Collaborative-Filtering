Knowledge of lexical aspect, e.g., (a)telicity, is therefore required for interpreting event sequences in discourse (Dowty, 1986; Moens and Steedman, 1988; Passoneau, 1988), interfacing to temporal databases (Androutsopoulos, 1996), processing temporal modifiers (Antonisse, 1994), describing allowable alternations and their semantic effects (Resnik, 1996; Tenny, 1994), and selecting tense and lexical items for natural language generation ((Dorr and Olsen, 1996; Klavans and Chodorow, 1992), cf. 
Klavans and Chodorow (1992) pioneered the application of statistical corpus analysis to aspectual classification by placing verbs on a scale according to the frequency with which they occur with certain aspectual markers from Table 2. 
604 Siegel and McKeown Improving Aspectual Classification 4.1 Logistic Regression As suggested by Klavans and Chodorow (1992), a weighted sum of multiple indicators that results in one "overall" indicator may provide an increase in classification performance. 
The English Slot Grammar (ESG) (McCord, 1990) has previously been used on corpora to accumulate aspectual data (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992).

We are constructing the Hinoki treebank as part of a larger project in cognitive and computational linguistics ultimately aimed at natural language understanding (Bond et al. , 2004). 
Furthermore, to test the grammar precision and accuracy, we use two treebanks: Redwoods (Oepen et al. , 2002) for English and Hinoki (Bond et al. , 2004) for Japanese. 
In this paper we discuss the (lexical) semantic annotation for the Hinoki Corpus, which is part of a larger project in psycho-linguistic and computational linguistics ultimately aimed at language understanding (Bond et al. , 2004). 
We have constructed a linguistically enriched treebank named Hinoki (Bond et al. , 2004a), which is based on the same framework as the Redwoods treebank (Oepen et al. , 2002) and uses the Japanese grammar JACY (Siegel and Bender, 2002) to construct the treebank.1 In the construction process, we have also encountered the problem just mentioned. 
In the next phase of the Hinoki project, we are concentrating on acquiring an ontology from these semantic representations and using it to improve the parse selection (Bond et al. , 2004).

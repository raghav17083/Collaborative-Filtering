This preference is the inverse of the lexical choice in text generation off of text meaning representations (for details see Nirenburg and Nirenburg, 1988). 
Classification of Machine Translation Divergences The divergence problem in machine translation has received increasingly greater attention in recent literature (see, for example, Barnett et al. 1991a, 1991b; Beaven 1992a, 1992b; Dorr 1990a, 1990b; Kameyama et al. 1991; Kinoshita, Phillips, and Tsujii 1992; Lindop and Tsujii 1991; Tsujii and Fujita 1991; Whitelock 1992; related discussion can also be found in work by Melby \[1986\] and Nirenburg and Nirenburg \[1988\]). 
~Text phmning in DIOGF3qES is described in detail Defrise and Nirenburg, 1989; the language for writing planning rules, in Nirenburg et al. , in preparation; the lexical selection in DIOGF.NF'^S is described, e.g., in Nirenburg and Nirenburg, 1988. 
E-maih reitel@aitma.edinburgh.ac.uk I This paper does not exmnine the kind of oollocational and selectional constraints discussed by Cumming (1986) and Nirenburg and Nirenburg (1988).

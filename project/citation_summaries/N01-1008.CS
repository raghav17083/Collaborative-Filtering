WordNet has also been used as an important feature in machine learning of coreference resolution using supervised training data (Soon et al. , 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002). 
Early work of anaphora resolution focuses on finding antecedents of pronouns (Hobbs, 1976; Ge et al. , 1998; Mitkov, 1998), while recent advances (Soon et al. , 2001; Yang et al. , 2003; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Ittycheriah et al. , 2003) employ statistical machine learning methods and try to resolve reference among all kinds of noun phrases (NP), be it a name, nominal, or pronominal phrase  which is the scope of this paper as well. 
The model (9) is very similar to the model in (Morton, 2000; Soon et al. , 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002) while (8) has more conditions. 
1 Introduction The last years have seen a boost of work devoted to the development of machine learning based coreference resolution systems (Soon et al. , 2001; Ng & Cardie, 2002; Yang et al. , 2003; Luo et al. , 2004, inter alia). 
In numerous articles the usefulness of this data and software ensemble has been demonstrated (e.g., for word sense disambiguation (Patwardhan et al., 2003), the analysis of noun phrase conjuncts (Hogan, 2007), or the resolution of coreferences (Harabagiu et al., 2001)).

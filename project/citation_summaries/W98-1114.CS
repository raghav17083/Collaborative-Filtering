Several techniques and results have been reported on learning subcategorization frames (SFs) from text corpora (Webster and Marcus, 1989; Brent, 1991; Brent, 1993; Brent, 1994; Ushioda et al. , 1993; Manning, 1993; Ersan and Charniak, 1996; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Carroll and Minnen, 1998; Carroll and Rooth, 1998). 
Some examples for English include the English parser used in tide SPARKLE project \[Briscoe et al. , \] \[Carroll et al. , 1997b\] \[Carroll et al. , 1998b\] and the finder built with a memory-based approach \[Argamon et aI. 
(Carroll et al. , 1998b), important for many NLP tasks (e.g. automatic verb classification (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002)) and useful for any application which can benefit from information about predicate-argument structure (e.g. Information Extraction (IE) (Surdeanu et al. , 2003)). 
There are some models which calculate the likelihood values of a dependency between bunsetsu i and j as in (6), such as a decision tree model (Haruno et al. , 1998), a maximum entropy model (Uchimoto et al. , 1999), a model based on distance and lexical information (Pujio and Matsumoto, 1998). 
a syntactic lexicon of ~26,400 subcategorization frames for nouns, verbs and adjectives derived from the Italian PAROLE syntactic lexicon (Ruimy et al. 1998).

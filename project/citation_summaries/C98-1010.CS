Thus, over the past few years, along with advances in the use of learning and statistical methods for acquisition of full parsers (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997a; Charniak, 1997b; Ratnaparkhi, 1997), significant progress has been made on the use of statistical learning methods to recognize shallow parsing patterns  syntactic phrases or words that participate in a syntactic relationship (Church, 1988; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Argamon et al. , 1998; Cardie and Pierce, 1998; Munoz et al. , 1999; Punyakanok and Roth, 2001; Buchholz et al. , 1999; Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). 
(Argamon et al. , 1998) use Memory-Based Sequence Learning for recognizing both NP chunks and VP chunks. 
Some examples for English include the English parser used in tide SPARKLE project \[Briscoe et al. , \] \[Carroll et al. , 1997b\] \[Carroll et al. , 1998b\] and the finder built with a memory-based approach \[Argamon et aI. 
Of the several slightly different definitions of a base NP in the literature we use for the purposes of this work the definition presented in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) and used also by (Argamon et al. , 1998)and others. 
(Argamon et al. , 1998) introduce Memory-Based Sequence Learning and use it for different chunking experiments.

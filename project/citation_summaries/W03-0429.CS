The latter is currently dominating in NER amongst which the most popular methods are decision tree (Sekine et al. , 1998; Pailouras et al. , 2000), Hidden Markov Model (Zhang et al. , 2003; Zhao, 2004), maximum entropy (Chieu and Ng, 2002; Bender et al. , 2003), and support vector machines (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002; Takeuchi and Collier, 2002; Mayfield, 2003). 
Another combination of five systems (Carreras et al. , 2003b; Mayfield et al. , 2003; McCallum and Li, 2003; Munro et al. , 2003; Zhang and Johnson, 2003) obtained the best result for the German development data. 
Transformation-based learning (Florian et al. , 2003), Support Vector Machines (Mayfield et al. , 2003) and Conditional Random Fields (McCallum and Li, 2003) were applied by one system each. 
(Klein et al. , 2003), (Mayfield et al. , 2003), (Wu et al. , 2003), (Kozareva et al. , 2005c) among others, combined several classifiers to obtain better named entity coverage rate. 
Hidden Markov Models were employed by four of the systems that took part in the shared task (Florian et al. , 2003; Klein et al. , 2003; Mayfield et al. , 2003; Whitelaw and Patrick, 2003).

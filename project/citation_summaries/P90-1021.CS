As other researchers pursued efficient default unification (Bouma, 1990; Russell et al. , 1991; Copestake, 1993), we also propose another definition of default unification, which we call lenient default unification. 
If this condition is met then the application of defaults always succeeds, producing a feature structure which, if no member of the default set is applicable, is identical to ~b. This interpretation of default unification is essentially that of Bouma (1990). 
The operation is a kind of union where the information in the strict structure takes priority over that in the ~See, for example, Bouma (1990), Calder (1990), Carpenter (1994), Kaplan (1987). 
Acknowledgments A syntactic approach to default unification is presented in Bouma (1990). 
As Bouma (1990) points out, the result of defaulting under this approach may depend on order of application.

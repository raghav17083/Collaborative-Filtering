32 In certain cases an extension of the constraint language with named disjunctions or contexted constraints (Maxwell and Kaplan 1989; Eisele and D6rre 1990; Griffith 1996) can be used to circumvent constraint propagation.


Griffith (Griffith, 1995; Griffith, 1996) points out the same problem and proposes a compilation method for feature structures called modularization.

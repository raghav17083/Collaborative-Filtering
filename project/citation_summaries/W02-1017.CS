Weakly supervised learning methods for semantic lexicon generation have utilized co-occurrence statistics (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Roark and Charniak, 1998), syntactic information (Tanev and Magnini, 2006; Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004; Phillips and Riloff, 2002), lexico-syntactic contextual patterns (e.g., resides in <location> or moved to <location>) (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002), and local and global contexts (Fleischman and Hovy, 2002). 
Pantel and Lin (2002) and Phillips and Riloff (2002) have pointed out that WordNet often includes many rare senses while missing out domainspecific senses andterminology. 
4.2 Bootstrapping methods for constructing semantic lexicons A common trend for the semantic lexicon construction task is that of bootstrapping, exploiting strong syntactic cues  such as a bootstrapping method that iteratively grows seeds by using cooccurrences in lists, conjunctions, and appositives (Roark and Charniak, 1998); metabootstrapping which repeatedly finds extraction patterns and extracts words from the found patterns (Riloff and Jones, 1999); a co-training combination of three bootstrapping processes each of which exploits appositives, compound nouns, and ISA-clauses (Phillips and Riloff, 2002). 
Phillips and Riloff (2002) and Pantel and Lin (2002) also describe work on clustering nouns to derivesemantic classes. 
Weakly supervised corpus-based methods have utilized noun co-occurrence statistics (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Roark and Charniak, 1998), syntactic information (Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Phillips and Riloff, 2002; Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004; Tanev and Magnini, 2006), and lexico-syntactic contextual patterns (e.g., resides in <location> or moved to <location>) (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002).

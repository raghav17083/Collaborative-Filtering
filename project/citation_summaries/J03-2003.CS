The range of reports for any given patient at any given point in their illness thus present a special class of paraphrase, with a looser adherance to semantic equivalence between versions than is typically found in other paraphrase generators, for example Kozlowski et al (2003), McKeown et al (1994), Power, Scott and Bouyaad-Agha (2003), Rosner and Stede (1994),(1996), and Scott and Souza (1990). 
At the moment the elementary trees in the grammar contain document structure nodes (Power et al., 2003) which are not used by the generator. 
4 Deriving the rhetorical-semantic input We have shown that by defining text-structuring as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, our method allows considerable flexibility and precision in controlling the generation of paraphrases (Power et al. , 2003). 
However few natural language understanding systems use graphical presentational features to aid interpretation (Power et al. , 2003). 
Our paraphrase generator links an existing general-purpose discourse parser  DAS (Le Thanh et al. , 2004)2  which builds a discourse tree automatically from an input text, to an existing NLG system ICONOCLAST (Power et al. , 2003)  which generates a wide range of 2Similar parsers have been developed by Marcu (2000) and Corston-Oliver (1998) 78 formulations for a given discourse structure.

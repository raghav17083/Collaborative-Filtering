The fact that summary quality improves with increasing summary length has been observed in prior studies as well (Radev and Tam, 2003; Lin and Hovy, 2003b; Kolluru and Gotoh, 2005) but generally little attention has been paid to this fact in system development and no specific user studies are available to show what summary length might be most suitable for specific applications.

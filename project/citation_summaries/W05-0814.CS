J07-3002:1	155:164	A good example of the former are our own results (Fraser and Marcu 2005).

J07-3002:2	162:164	F-Measure with an appropriate setting of  will be useful during the development process of new alignment models, or as a maximization criterion for discriminative training of alignment models (Cherry and Lin 2003; Ayan, Dorr, and Monz 2005; Ittycheriah and Roukos 2005; Liu, Liu, and Lin 2005; Fraser and Marcu 2006; Lacoste-Julien et al. 2006; Moore, Yih, and Bode 2006).
---------------------------------------------------
W05-0809:3	85:120	Given numerous (constructive) debates held during the previous word alignment evaluation, which questioned the informativeness of the NULL alignment evaluations, we decided 67 Team System name Description Carnegie Mellon University SPA (Brown et al. , 2005) Information Sciences Institute / USC ISI (Fraser and Marcu, 2005) Johns Hopkins University JHU (Schafer and Drabek, 2005) Microsoft Research MSR (Moore, 2005) Romanian Academy Institute of Artificial Intelligence TREQ-AL, MEBA, COWAL (Tufis et al. , 2005) University of Maryland / UMIACS UMIACS (Lopez and Resnik, 2005) University of Sheffield Sheffield (Aswani and Gaizauskas, 2005a) University of Montreal JAPA, NUKTI (Langlais et al. , 2005) University of Sao Paulo, University of Alicante LIHLA (Caseli et al. , 2005) University Jaume I MAR (Vilar, 2005) Table 1: Teams participating in the word alignment shared task to evaluate only no-NULL alignments, and thus the NULL alignments were removed from both submissions and gold standard data.
---------------------------------------------------
H05-1011:4	173:181	Fraser and Marcu (2005) modify Model 4 to be a log-linear combination of 11 submodels (5 based on standard Model 4 parameters, and 6 based on additional features) and discriminatively optimize the submodel weights on each iteration of a Viterbi approximation to EM.
---------------------------------------------------
E06-1006:5	23:157	Similar morphological simplifications have been applied to other languages such as Romanian (Fraser and Marcu, 2005) in order to decrease word alignment error rate.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1065:6	8:192	In 2005, however, several independent efforts (Liu et al. , 2005; Fraser and Marcu, 2005; Ayan et al. , 2005; Taskar et al. , 2005; Moore, 2005; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005) demonstrated that discriminatively trained models can equal or surpass the alignment accuracy of the standard models, if the usual unlabeled bilingual training corpus is supplemented with human-annotated word alignments for only a small subset of the training data.

Yarowsky (1992) proposed a method for sense disambiguation using wide contexts. 
Statistics on co-occurrence of words in a local context were used recently for monolingual word sense disambiguation (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992b, 1993; Sch6tze 1992, 1993) (see Section 7 for more details and Church and Hanks 1990; Smadja 1993, for other applications of these statistics). 
(1991) and Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, (1992a, 1993) propose the use of bilingual corpora to avoid hand-tagging of training data. 
J J,II Parallel Translations as Sense Discriminators Nancy IDE Department of Computer Science Vassar College 124 Raymond Avenue Poughkeepsie, NY 12604-0520 USA lde@cs vassar edu Abstract This article reports the results of a prehmlnary analysis of translation equivalents in four languages from different language famdles, extracted from an on-hne parallel corpus of George Orwell's Nmeteen Eighty-Four The goal of the study is to determine the degree to which translatmn equivalents for different meamngs of a polysemous word In Enghsh are lexlcahzed differently across a variety of languages, and to detelmme whether this information can be used to structure or create a set of sense distinctions useful in natural language processing apphcatmns A coherence Index is computed that measures the tendency for different senses o1 the same English word to be lexlcahzed differently, and flora this data a clustering algorithm is used to create sense hierat chles Introduction It ~s well known that the most nagging issue for word sense disamblguanon (WSD) Is the definmon of just what a word sense is At its base, the problem Is a philosophical and linguistic one that is far from being resolved However, work in automated language processing has led to effotts to flnd practical means to dlstmgmsh word senses, at least to the degree that they are useful for natural language processing tasks such as summarization, document retrieval, and machine translataon Several criteria have been suggested and exploited to automatically determine the sense of a word m context (see Ide and V6roms, 1998), including syntactic behavior, semantic and pragmatic knowledge, and especially in more recent empirical studies, word co-occurrence within syntactic relations (e g, Hearst, 1991, Yarowsky, 1993), words co-occurring m global context (e g, Gale et al, 1993, Yarowsky, 1992 Schutze, 1992, 1993), etc No clear criteria have emerged, however, and the problem continues to loom large for WSD work The notion that cross-hngual comparison can be useful fol sense dlsamblguauon has served as a basis for some recent work on WSD Foi example, Brown et al (1991)and Gale et al (1992a, 1993) used the parallel, aligned Hansard Corpus of Canadian Parhamentary debates foi WSD, and Dagan et al (1991) and Dagan and Ital (1994) used monohngual corpora of Hebrew and German and a bilingual dictionary These studies rely on the assumption that the mapping between words and word senses vanes significantly among languages For example, the word duty in English t~anslates into French as devoir m ~ts obhgatlon sense, and tmpOt m ~ts tax sense By determining the translation 52,--. 
The best results reported for an unsupervised sense disambiguation method are those of Yarowsky (1992), who uses evidence from a wider context (a window of 100 surrounding words) to build up a co-occurrence model using classes from Roget's thesaurus.

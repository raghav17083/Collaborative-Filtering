c2008 Association for Computational Linguistics A Rule-Driven Dynamic Programming Decoder for Statistical MT Christoph Tillmann IBM T.J. Watson Research Center Yorktown Heights, N.Y. 10598 ctill@us.ibm.com Abstract The paper presents an extension of a dynamic programming (DP) decoder for phrase-based SMT (Koehn, 2004; Och and Ney, 2004) that tightly integrates POS-based re-order rules (Crego and Marino, 2006) into a left-to-right beam-search algorithm, rather than handling them in a pre-processing or re-order graph generation step. 
This paper uses the notion of edges as well following (Tillmann, 2006) where phrase-based decoding is also linked to a DAG path finding problem. 
While certain similarities of SMT decoding and TSP were already pointed out in (Knight, 1999), where it was shown that any Traveling Salesman Problem may be reformulated as an instance of a (simplistic) SMT decoding task, and while certain techniques used for TSP were then adapted to word-based SMT decoding (Germann et al., 2001; Tillmann and Ney, 2003; Tillmann, 2006), we are not aware of any previous work that shows that SMT decoding can be directly reformulated as a TSP. 
The expression block is used here to emphasize that pairs of phrases (especially longer phrases) tend to form closely linked units in such a way that the translation process can be formalized as a block segmentation process (Nagata et al., 2006; Tillmann and Zhang, 2007). 
In (Tillmann and Ney, 2003) and (Tillmann, 2006), the authors modify a certain Dynamic Programming technique used for TSP for use with an IBM4 word-based model and a phrase-based model respectively.

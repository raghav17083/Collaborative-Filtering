The sentences appearing under the back-translation at the top are produced by an online help component, and are intended to guide the user into the grammars coverage (Chatzichrisafis et al., 2006). 
In order to assist in this, a help system is included in the system (Starlander et al. , 2005 and Chatzichrisafis et al. , 2006). 
Not analyzed sentences (21.8%) are those which are not covered by the English grammar but had to be reformulated in an existent structure with the help system (see above; Chatzichrisafis, et al. , 2006). 
As previously noted, the MedSLT system addresses this problem by incorporating an online help system (Starlander et al. , 2005; Chatzichrisafis et al. , 2006). 
Our experiments with MedSLT show that even a quite simple help system is enough to guide users quickly towards the intended coverage of a mediumvocabulary grammar-based speech translation application, with most users appearing confident after just an hour or two of exposure (Starlander et al. , 2005; Chatzichrisafis et al. , 2006).

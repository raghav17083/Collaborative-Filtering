The method for detecting annotation errors can be extended to discontinuous constituency annotation (Dickinson and Meurers, 2005), making it applicable to dependency annotation, where words in a relation can be arbitrarily far apart. 
We use the method in Dickinson and Meurers (2005) to efficiently calculate the NIL tokens. 
Breaking the representation down into strings whch receive a label also makes the method applicable to other annotation types (e.g., Dickinson and Meurers, 2005). 
Dickinson and Meurers (2005) point out that, as language processing begins to tackle problems in free-word order languages and discourse analysis, annotating and extracting non-contiguous segmentations of text will become increasingly important. 
For this purpose, (Schutze and Singer, 1994) adopted a variable memory Markov model proposed by (Ron et al. , 1996), (Kim et al. , 2003) applied selective extension of features to POS tagging, and (Dickinson and Meurers, 2005) expanded context of D2-gram models to find errors in syntactic anno634 tation.

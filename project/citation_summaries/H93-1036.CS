Paradigmatic semantic relations in WordNet have been used for diverse NL problems, including disambiguation of syntactic structure (Resnik, 1993) and semiautomatic construction of a large-scale ontology for machine translation (Knight, 1993). 
There is a long history of work on ontolo,~ies for CL, including/he important work at Carnegie-Meffbn University over many years, that of Dahlgren and her collea,~ues (e.g. Dahlgren 1988) and the current Pangloss ProjecT, as described in Hovy and Nirenburg 1992, Hovy and Knight 1993 and Knight 1993. 
We are introducing some semantic taxonomy and the semantic distance measurement algorithm(Knight, 1993; Okumura and Hovy, 1994; Resnik, 1993). 
To enhance the semantic processing in MT systems, many system include conceptual networks called ontologies or semantic taxonomies \[Bateman, 1990; Carlson and Nirenburg, 1990; Hovy and Knight, 1993; Klavans et al. , 1990; Klavans et al. , 1991; Knight, 1993\]. 
A seemingly reasonable method to the problem would be common word strategy, which has been extensively studied by many researchers (e.g., Knight, 1993; Lesk, 1986).

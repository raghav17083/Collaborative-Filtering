Meanwhile, example-based MT(Nagao, 1984; Sato, 1992; Brown, 1999) obtains translation results by substituting semantically similar elements in structurally matching translation examples, so a pre-prepared pattern dictionary is not needed. 
We get around this by associating all incremental weight with each matelfing segment assessing the contiguity of left-neighl)ouring segments, in the manner (Inscribed by Sato (1992) for chaxactcrbased matclfing. 
In addition to their use in machine translation (Sato & Nagao, 1990; Brown et al. , 1993; Melamed, 1997), translation models can be applied to machineassisted translation (Sato, 1992; Foster et al. , 1996), cross-lingual information retrieval (SIGIR, 1996), and gisting of World Wide Web pages (Resnik, 1997). 
Weighted sequential correspondence associates an incremental weight (orthogonal to our wt weights)witheachmatchingsegmentassessingthe contiguity of left-neighbouring segments, in the manner described by Sato(1992) for characterbased matching. 
1 Introduction Corpus-based approaches based on bilingual texts are promising for various applications(i.e. , lexical knowledge extraction (Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al. , 1993; Smadja et al. , 1996; Dagan and Church, 1994; Kumano and Hirakawa, 1994; Haruno et al. , 1996), machine translation (Brown and others, 1993; Sato and Nagao, 1990; Kaji et al. , 1992) and information retrieval (Sato, 1992)).

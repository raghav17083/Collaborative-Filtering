Perhaps the most related is 86 learning as search optimization (LASO) (Daume III and Marcu, 2005b; Daume III and Marcu, 2005a). 
Other similar work includes the mention detection (MD) task (Florian et al., 2006) and joint probabilistic model of coreference (Daume III and Marcu, 2005). 
(DaumeIII and Marcu, 2005a) use the Learning as Search Optimization framework to take into account the non-locality behavior of the coreference features. 
While early machine learning approaches for the task relied on local, discriminative classifiers (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002b; Morton, 2000; Kehler et al., 2004), more recent approaches use joint and/or global models (McCallum and Wellner, 2004; Ng, 2004; Daume III and Marcu, 2005; Denis and Baldridge, 2007a). 
In contrast, globally optimized clustering decisions were reported in (Luo et al. , 2004) and (DaumeIII and Marcu, 2005a), where all clustering possibilities are considered by searching on a Bell tree representation or by using the Learning as Search Optimization (LaSO) framework (DaumeIII and Marcu, 2005b) respectively, but the first search is partial and driven by heuristics and the second one only looks back in text.

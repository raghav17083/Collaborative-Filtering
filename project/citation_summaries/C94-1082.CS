A similar approach, using finite state parsing technology, has been proposed by Grefenstette in (Grefenstette, 1996) where the main applications are slanted to the extraction of syntactic information 2.1 Robust Definite Clause Grammars LHIP (Left-corner Head-driven Island Parser) (Ballim and Russell, 1994; Lieske and Ballim, 1998) is a system which performs robust analysis of its input, using a grammar defined in an extended form of the PROLOG Definite Clause Grammars (DCGs).

They can be roughly divided into three categories: string-to-tree models (e.g., (Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008)), tree-to-string models (e.g., (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006)), and tree-totree models (e.g., (Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008)). 
This algorithm is referred to as GHKM (Galley et al., 2004) and is widely used in SSMT systems (Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006). 
By contrast, explicit syntax approaches seek to directly model the relations learned from parsed data, including models between source trees and target trees (Gildea, 2003; Eisner, 2003; Melamed, 2004; Cowan et al. , 2006), source trees and target strings (Quirk et al. , 2005; Huang et al. , 2006), or source strings and target trees (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al. , 2004). 
Based on these grammars, a great number of SMT models have been recently proposed, including string-to-string model (Synchronous FSG) (Brown et al., 1993; Koehn et al., 2003), tree-to-string model (TSG-string) (Huang et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007), string-totree model (string-CFG/TSG) (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006), tree-to-tree model (Synchronous CFG/TSG, Data-Oriented Translation) (Chiang, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Zhang et al., 2007; Bod, 2007; Quirk wt al., 2005; Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003) and so on. 
We wish to apply this direct, Bayesian approach to learn better translation rules for syntaxbased statistical MT (SSMT), by which we specifically refer to MT systems using Tree-to-String (TTS) translation templates derived from syntax trees (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006; Galley et al., 2006; May and Knight, 2007), as opposed to formally syntactic systems such as Hiero (Chiang, 2007).

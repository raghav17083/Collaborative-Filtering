For comparable corpora, previous bilingual sentence or word pair extraction works are based soly on bilexical context assumption (Fung & McKeown 1995, Rapp 1995, Grefenstette 1998, Fung and Lo 1998, Kikui 1999, Barzilay and Elhadad 2003, Masao and Hitoshi 2003, Kenji and Hideki 2002). 
For other related work, see, for example, (Brown et al. 1991; Dagan and Itai 1994; Pedersen and Bruce 1997; Schutze 1998; Kikui 1999; Mihalcea and Moldovan 1999). 
Kikui (1999) used a word sense disambiguation algorithm and a non-paralM bilingual corpus to resolve translation ambiguity. 
For other methods using non-parallel corpora, see also (Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Kikui, 1999, Koehn and Kevin 2000; Sumita 2000; Nakagawa 2001; Gao et al, 2001). 
Previously, the author and other researchers had suggested that bi-lexical information based on context can still be used to find correspondences between passages, sentences, or words, in non-parallel, comparable texts of the same topic (Fung and McKeown 1995, Rapp 1995, Grefenstette 1998, Fung and Lo 1998, Kikui 1999).

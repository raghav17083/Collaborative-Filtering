This has been successful in different domains (Preston and Williams 1994) and is, in fact, the approach used in recent commercial summarizers (Apple \[Boguraev and Kennedy 1997\], Microsoft, and inXight). 
Several techniques for text summarization have been reported in the literature, including methods based on position (Edmundson, 1969; Hovy and Lin, 1997; Teufel and Moens, 1997), cue phrase (McKeown and Radev, 1995; Mahesh, 1997), word frequency (Teufel and Moens, 1997), and discourse segmentation (Boguraev and Kennedy, 1997). 
NP chunks and technical terms have been proposed for use in this task (Boguraev and Kennedy 1997; Wacholder 1998). 
Approaches based on sentence position (Edmundson, 1969), cue phrase (McKeown and Radev, 1995), word frequency (Teufel and Moens, 1997), and discourse segmentation (Boguraev and Kennedy, 1997) have been reported. 
Many of these documents are likely to repeat much the same information, while differing in certain i Most of these were based on statistical techniques applied to various document entities; examples include frait, 1983; Kupiec et al. , 1995; Paice, 1990, Klavans and Shaw, 1995; MeKeown et al. , 1995; Shaw, 1995; Aon et al. , 1997; Boguraev and Kennedy, 1997; Hovy and Lin, 1997; Mitra et al. , 1997; Teufel and Moens, 1997; Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997; Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; Baldwin and Mortbn, 1998; Radev and McKeown, 1998; Strzalkowski et al. , 1998).

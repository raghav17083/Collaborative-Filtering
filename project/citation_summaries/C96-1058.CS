Using this representation, the parsing algorithm of Eisner (1996) is sufficient for searching over all projective trees in O(n3) time. 
2 Dependency Reparsing In dependency reparsing we focus on unlabeled dependencies, as described by Eisner (1996). 
Most researchers have used an n-gram model (Eisner, 1996; Charniak, 2000) or more general Markov model (Alshawi, 1996) to model the sequence of nonterminals in the RHS. 
There are some algorithms 1149 Figure 1: This is an example of dependency tree to determine these relations of each word to another words, for instance, the modified CKY algorithm (Eisner, 1996) is used to define these relations for a given sentence. 
Eisner (1996) proposed probabilistic models of dependency parsing.

For the partial grammar acquisition, in our previous works, we have proposed a mechanism to acquire a partial grammar automatically from a bracketed corpus based on local contextual information(Theeramunkong and Okumura, 1996) and have shown the effectiveness of the derived grammar(Theeramunkong and Okumura, 1997).


More detail can be found in (Theeramunkong and Okumura, 1996).

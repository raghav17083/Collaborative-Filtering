Using this system, (Aw et al., 2006) reports a 0.81 BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) score on a set of 5,000 English SMS. 
For texting language, given the abundance of creative forms, and the wide-ranging possibilities for creating new forms, normalization is a particularly important problem, and has indeed received some attention in computational linguistics (e.g., Aw et al., 2006; Choudhury et al., 2007; Kobus et al., 2008). 
This metaphor is, nonetheless, the one resorted to in (Aw et al., 2006), which uses a statistical phrase-based machine translation tool to convert English SMS texts into standardized English. 
These short messages have so far received relatively little attention from the NLP community2: see, for English, (Aw et al., 2006; Choudhury et al., 2007), which both address the problem with statistical learning techniques, and, for French, (Guimier de Neef et al., 2007), which details a complete pipe-line of hand-crafted, symbolic, modules. 
The corresponding BLEU score is close to 0,8, in line with the findings of (Aw et al., 2006) for English, and comparing favorably with the 0.68 score reported in (Guimier de Neef et al., 2007) (for French, using a different test bed).

All these approaches are adaptations of statistical models for machine translation (Brown et al., 1994). 
Related Work The recent availability of large amounts of bilingual data has attracted interest in several areas, including sentence alignment (Gale and Church 1991b; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Simard, Foster and Isabelle 1992; Gale and Church 1993; Chen 1993), word alignment (Gale and Church 1991a; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994; Fung 1995b), alignment of groups of words (Smadja 1992; Kupiec 1993; van der Eijk 1993), and statistical translation (Brown et al. 1993). 
(1994) describes the French-to-English Candide translation system, which uses the translation model proposed in Brown et al. 
A well-known example is the training of the IBM models for statistical machine translation (Berger et al. , 1994). 
The translation cost 278 between a phrase translation pair (f,e) is defined as TM(e,f) =summationdisplay i i(i) (1) where feature cost functions (i) includes: logp(f|e), a target-to-source word translation cost, calculated based on unnormalized IBM model1 cost (Brown et al. , 1994); p(f|e) =productdisplay j summationdisplay i t(fj|ei) (2) where t(fj|ei) is the word translation probabilities, estimated based on word alignment frequencies over all the training data.

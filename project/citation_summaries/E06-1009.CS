Previous research on cooperative responses has noted that summary strategies should vary according to the context (Sparck Jones, 1993), and the interests and preferences of the user (Gaasterland et al., 1992; Carenini and Moore, 2000; Demberg and Moore, 2006). 
For example, the CG to present database results to the user can be realized as a summary (Polifroni and Walker, 2008; Demberg andMoore, 2006), orbycomparingitems (Walker et al., 2004), or by picking one item and recommending it to the user (Young et al., 2007). 
U = User to more natural, effective, or efficient dialogues (Litman et al.1998; Demberg and Moore, 2006); and (2) Previous work has hand-crafted such responses, or hand-annotated the database to support them (Kaplan, 1984; Kalita et al., 1986; Cholvy, 1990; Polifroni et al., 2003; Benamara, 2004), which has made it difficult to port and scale these algorithms. 
(Walker et al., 2004; Demberg and Moore, 2006), user knowledge, e.g. 
While (Demberg and Moore, 2006) found that their user model stepwise refinement (UMSR) method was superior to the Refiner method, they also found many situations (70 out of 190) in which the Refiner method was preferred.

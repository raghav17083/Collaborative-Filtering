Transformation based learning(TBL)(Brill, 1995) is a machine learning approach for rule learning. 
Many approaches for POS tagging have been developed in the past, including rule-based tagging (Brill, 1995), HMM taggers (Brants, 2000; Cutting and others, 1992), maximum-entropy models (Rathnaparki, 1996), cyclic dependency networks (Toutanova et al. , 2003), memory-based learning (Daelemans et al. , 1996), etc. All of these approaches require either a large amount of annotated training data (for supervised tagging) or a lexicon listing all possible tags for each word (for unsupervised tagging). 
In certain respects, our approach has been motivated by Brill's recent work (Brill, 1995b), but with the observation that his transformational approach is not directly applicable to languages like Turkish. 
Transformation-Based Learning To compute dialogue acts, we are using a modified version of Brill's (1995a) TransformationBased Learning method. 
4 Unsupervised Tagging: A Comparison 4.1 Corpora and Lexicon Construction For our comparison of unsupervised tagging methods, we implemented the HMM taggers described in Merialdo (1991) and Kupiec (1992), as well as the UTBL tagger described in Brill (1995).

2.2 Paraphrasing in MT A recent strategy to broadly deal with the problem of unknown terms is to paraphrase the source text with terms whose translation is known to the system, using paraphrases learnt from multilingual corpora, typically involving at least one pivot language different from the target language of immediate interest (Callison-Burch et 792 al., 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Zhao et al., 2008; Callison-Burch, 2008; Guzman and Garrido, 2008). 
Some possible ways of improving it, besides using larger corpora, are: using syntactic information (Callison-Burch, 2008), using semantic knowledge such as thesaurus or WordNet to perform word sense disambiguation (WSD) (Resnik, 1999; Mohammad and Hirst, 2006), improving the similarity measure, and refining the similarity threshold. 
For example, (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005) and (Callison-Burch, 2008) described a method to extract paraphrases from largely available bilingual corpora. 
For instance, for the predicate alignment, we may consider to use DIRT rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001) or other paraphrase resources (Callison-Burch, 2008), and for the argument alignment, external named-entity recognizer and anaphora resolver would be very helpful. 
We would like to explore ways of incorporating syntactic knowledge that do not sacrifice coverage as much as in Callison-Burch (2008); incorporating semantic knowledge to disambiguate phrasal senses; using context to help sense disambiguation (Erk and Pad, 2008); and optimizing the similarity threshold for use in SMT, for example on a held-out dataset: too high a threshold reduces coverage, while too low a threshold results in bad paraphrases and translation.

Syntax Driven Continuous Speech Recognition The general trend in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition research is that of building integrated systems (Huang, 1990; Murveit, 1990; Paul, 1990; Austin, 1990) in which all the relevant knowledge sources, namely acoustic, phonetic, lexical, syntactic, and semantic, are integrated into a unique representation.

At the MUC-7 conference, there were two other interesting systems using statistical techniques from the Language Technology Group/University of Edinborough (Mikheev and Grover, 1998) and BBN (Miller et al. , 1998). 
Solne of this work has enli)hasized il\]teractive tools to (:onvert examples to extractioi~ t)atterlls (Yangarber and Grishman, 1997); nmch ot:' the re, search has focused on methods for automatically converting a cortms annotated with extraction examples into patterns (Lehnert et al. , 1992; Fisher et al. , 1995; Miller el; al. , 1998). 
The state-of-the-art exemplified by systems such as NetOwl [Krupka & Hausman 1998], IdentiFinder [Miller et al 1998] and InfoXtract [Srihari et al 2000] has reached near human performance, with 90% or above F-measure. 
One of the systems evaluated for the Message Understanding Conference task (Miller et al. 1998) made use of an integrated syntactic and semantic model producing a full parse tree and achieved results comparable to other systems that did not make use of a complete parse. 
(Yangarber and Grishman, 1997), while others have focused on methods for automatically converting a corpus annotated with extraction examples into such patterns (Lehnert et al. , 1992; Fisher et al. , 1995; Miller et al. , 1998).

Bagshaw (1998) obtained 65%-83.3% per-syllable accuracy using Church (1985)s rule-based system. 
Thus IBM's WordSmith system (Byrd and Chodorow, 1985) is concerned primarily with providing a browsing functionality which supports retrieval of words ~close ~ to a given word along the dimensions of spelling, meaning and sound, while a group at Bell Labs has several large dictionaries on-line used only for research on stress assignment (Church, 1985).

There have been successful attempts to automatically detect the ethnic group of a proper name for use in anglophone countries like the United States, and to apply a different set of rules depending on that group (Church 1985, Vitale 1991).

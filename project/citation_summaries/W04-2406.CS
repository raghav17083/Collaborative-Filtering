Another system similar to ours is (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004), which unfortunately was evaluated on Senseval 2 data and is not included in the table. 
Our initial work (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004) focused on word sense discrimination, which takes as input contexts that each contain a given target word, and produces as output clusters that are presumed to correspond to the different senses of the word. 
Most of the unsupervised WSD work has been based on the vector space model, where each example is represented by a vector of features (e.g. the words occurring in the context), and the induced senses are either clusters of examples (Schcurrency1utze, 1998; Purandare and Pedersen, 2004) or clusters of words (Pantel and Lin, 2002). 
Table 4 also shows several unsupervised systems, all of which except Cymfony and (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004) participated in S3LS (check (Mihalcea et al. , 2004) for further details on the systems). 
It is an opensource project that is freelyavailable from sourceforge, and has been been described in detail in numerous publications (e.g. , (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004), (Pedersen et al. , 2005), (Pedersen and Kulkarni, 2007)).

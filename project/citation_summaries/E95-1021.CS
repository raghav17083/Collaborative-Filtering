Among others, it can be composed with transducers that encode:  correction rules for the most frequent tagging errors which are automatically generated (Brill, 1992; Roche and Schabes, 1995) or manually written (Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995), in order to significantly improve tagging accuracy 2. 
As suggested e.g. by Tapanainen and Voutilainen (1994) and Chanod and Tapanainen (1995), hand-coded heuristics may be a worthwhile addition to 'strictly' grammar-based rules. 
This task is similar to what was done by the guessers for the HMM-based French and German taggers (Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995; Feldweg, 1995). 
Among others, it can be composed with transducers that encode:  correction rules for the most frequent tagging errors which are automatically generated (Brill, 1992; Roche and Schabes, 1995) or manually written (Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995), in order to significantly improve tagging accuracy -9 . These rules may include long-distance dependencies not handled by ttMM taggers, and can conveniently be expressed by the replace operator (Kaplan and Kay, 1994; Karttunen, 1995; Kempe and Karttunen, 1996). 
Recently, new interest in the linguistic approach has been shown e.g. in the work of (Karlsson 1990: Voutilainen et al. 1992; Oflazer and Kuru6z 1994: Chanod and Tapanainen 1995: Karlsson et al.

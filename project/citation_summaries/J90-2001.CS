Tsutsumi (1990) presented a methodology for bridging stylistic gaps (stylistic differences) between the syntax of the source and target languages in MT. An important contribution of Tsutsumi's work is the recognition that computational stylistics is useful for the translation of pairs of languages that are not in the same language group.

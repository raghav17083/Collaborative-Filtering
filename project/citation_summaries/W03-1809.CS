2 Related Work Most previous work using distributional approaches to compositionality either contrasts distributional information of candidate phrases with constituent words (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001; Bannard et al. , 2003; Baldwin et al. , 2003; McCarthy et al. , 2003) or uses distributionally similar words to detect nonproductive phrases (Lin, 1999). 
This is especially interesting since much previous research has focused solely on the non-compositionality of MWEs to identify them (McCarthy et al. , 2003; Baldwin et al. , 2003; Bannard et al. , 2003). 
Previous studies determine compositionality by looking at the degree of distributional similarity between an expression and its component words (e.g. , McCarthy et al. , 2003; Bannard et al. , 2003; Baldwin et al. , 2003). 
Because of this variation, researchers have explored automatic methods for learning whether, or the degree to which, an MWE is compositional (e.g. , Lin, 1999; Bannard et al. , 2003; McCarthy et al. , 2003; Fazly et al. , 2005). 
Most previous work on compositionality of MWEs either treat them as collocations (Smadja, 1993), or examine the distributional similarity between the expression and its constituents (McCarthy et al. , 2003; Baldwin et al. , 2003; Bannard et al. , 2003).

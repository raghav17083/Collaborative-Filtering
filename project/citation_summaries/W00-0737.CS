Actually, the best individual system (Zhou et al 2000b) in CoNLL2000 chunking shared task for the English language (Tjong et al 2000) used the same HMM-based tagging engine. 
(Zhou,et al. , 2000) continued using the same methods, and achieved an accuracy of 91.99% precision and 92.25% recall using a contextual lexicon. 
The noun phrase identification and the predicate-argument extraction were done based on the results of a chunk tagger, which was trained for the shared task of CoNLL-2000 and achieved 92% accuracy (Zhou et al. , 2000). 
Analogous to (Zhou,et al. , 2000), we found that for certain POS categories, a combination of word and the POS category must be used in order to obtain good results. 
Additionally, many machine learning approaches, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs)(Vapnik, 1995), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)(Lafferty et al. , 2001), Memory-based Learning (MBL)(Park and Zhang, 2003), Transformation-based Learning (TBL)(Brill, 1995), and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)(Zhou et al. , 2000), have been applied to text chunking(Sang and Buchholz, 2000; Hammerton et al. , 2002).

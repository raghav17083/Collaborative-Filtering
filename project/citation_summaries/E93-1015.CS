In terms of alignment, this wordnumber difference means that multiword connections must be considered, a task which 334 Sue J. Ker and Jason S. Chang Word Alignment is beyond the reach of methods proposed in recent alignment works based on Brown et al.'s (1993) Model 1 and 2. 
have been used in statistical machine translation (Brown et al. , 1990), terminology research and translation aids (Isabelle, 1992; Ogden and Gonzales, 1993; van der Eijk, 1993), bilingual lexicography (Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990; Smadja, 1992), word-sense disambiguation (Brown et al. , 1991b; Gale et al. , 1992) and information retrieval in a multilingual environment (Landauer and Littman, 1990). 
Van der Eijk (1993) uses a similar approach for translating terms. 
Related Work The recent availability of large amounts of bilingual data has attracted interest in several areas, including sentence alignment (Gale and Church 1991b; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Simard, Foster and Isabelle 1992; Gale and Church 1993; Chen 1993), word alignment (Gale and Church 1991a; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994; Fung 1995b), alignment of groups of words (Smadja 1992; Kupiec 1993; van der Eijk 1993), and statistical translation (Brown et al. 1993).

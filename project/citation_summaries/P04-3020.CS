This definition of graph edges is slightly different from co-occurrence relations used in (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) for building undirected document graphs, where the order of word occurrence is ignored and the size of the cooccurrence window is varied between 2 and 10. 
Mihalcea (2004) and Mihalcea and Tarau (2004) have successfully explored very similar graph representations for extractive summarization and key word extraction. 
A term-distance based representation has been used successfully for a variety of tasks in Mihalcea (2004) and Mihalcea and Tarau (2004). 
There is recent interest on the use of graph methods for Natural Language Processing, such as document summarisation (Mihalcea, 2004) document retrieval (Montes-y-Gomez et al. , 2000; Mishne,2004),andrecognitionoftextualentailment (Pazienza et al. , 2005). 
A similar idea can be applied to lexical or semantic graphs extracted from text documents, in order to extract the most significant blocks (words, phrases, sentences, etc.) for the summary (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Mihalcea, 2004).

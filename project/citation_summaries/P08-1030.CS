We then apply the cross-document inference techniques as described in (Ji and Grishman, 2008) to improve trigger and argument labeling performance by favoring interpretation consistency across the test events and background events. 
The ACE program defines the following terminology for event extraction task: z Trigger: the word that most clearly expresses an events occurrence z Argument:  an entity, or a temporal expression or a value that plays a certain role in the event instance z Event mention: a phrase or sentence with a distinguished trigger and participant arguments Some English event extraction systems based on supervised learning have been reported by researchers (Ahn, 2006; Ji and Grishman, 2008). 
(2005) and Ji and Grishman (2008) incorporate global information by enforcing event role or label consistency over a document or across related documents. 
Various supervised learning approaches  1  http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/ have been explored for ACE multi-lingual event extraction (e.g. Grishman et al., 2005; Ahn, 2006; Hardy et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2008; Chen and Ji, 2009). 
In addition, the global evidence from related documents is combined with local decisions to conduct crossdocument inference for improving the extraction performance as described in (Ji and Grishman, 2008).

4 State-of-the-art in WSD for specific domains Initial work on domain adaptation for WSD systems showed that WSD systems were not able to obtain better results on the source or adaptation settings compared to the target settings (Escudero et al., 2000), showing that a generic WSD system (i.e. based on hand-annotated examples from a generic corpus) would not be useful when moved to new domains. 
6.2 Using Sense Priors Information As mentioned in section 1, research in (Escudero et al. , 2000) noted an improvement in accuracy when they adjusted the BC and WSJ datasets such that the proportions of the different senses of each word were the same between BC and WSJ. 
These results are more valuable given the lack of substantial positive results on the literature on semisupervised or supervised domain adaptation for WSD (Escudero et al., 2000; Martnez and Agirre, 2000; Chan and Ng, 2007). 
uating WSD systems on data drawn from different domains, several prior research efforts (Escudero et al., 2000; Martinez and Agirre, 2000) observed a similar drop in performance of about 10% when a WSD system that was trained on the BC part of the DSO corpus was evaluated on the WSJ part of the corpus, and vice versa. 
Supervised Word Sense Disambiguation systems trained on general corpora are known to perform worse when applied to specific domains (Escudero et al., 2000; Martnez and Agirre, 2000), and domain adaptation techniques have been proposed as a solution to this problem with mixed results.

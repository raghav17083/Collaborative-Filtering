First we will discuss the accentuation algorithm, which is based on a version of Focus-Accent Theory proposed in (Dirksen, 1992) and (Dirksen and Quen~, 1993).


Integration of a focus module into speech synthesis systems FDA, presented here on the basis of an operable definition of focus, enables the integration of a focus module into speech synthesis system; specifically, the output of FDA, i.e., the focus pattern of the message conveyed by the utterance, may be fed into a subsequent accent assignment module, one in the spirit of the Focus-Accent Theory of Dirksen (1992) and Dirksen & Quene (1993).


Recent work on integrating phonology with speech synthesis includes Hertz (1990), Coleman (1992), and Dirksen (1992), and there is also a large literature on the phonology of intonation as it relates to synthesis (e.g. Anderson, Pierrehumbert, and Liberman 1984; Ladd 1987).


Roughly, these are the leaves that can be reached through a path that starts from an expression that is 'in focus', and that does not contain weak nodes (Dirksen, 1992).

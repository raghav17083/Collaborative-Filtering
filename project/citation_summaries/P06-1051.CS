To positively exploit the training instance Pediatricians suggest women to feed newborns breast milk entails Pediatricians suggest that newborns eat breast milk (T2,H2) for classifying the above example, learning algorithms should learn that the two instances hide the first-order rule  = feedY Z  YeatZ . The first-order rule feature space, introduced by (Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006), gives high performances in term of accuracy for textual entailment recognition with respect to other features spaces. 
(Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) have utilized a tree kernel method to calculate the similarity between T and H, and (Wang and Neumann, 2007) chose subsequence kernel to reduce the computational complexity. 
One the best two teams in RTE-2 (Tatu et al. , 2006) proposed a knowledge representation model which achieved about 10% better performance than the third (Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) based on their logic prover. 
2 Cross-pair similarity and its limits 2.1 Learning entailment rules with syntactic cross-pair similarity The cross-pair similarity model (Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) proposes a similarity measure aiming at capturing rewrite rules from training examples, computing a cross-pair similarity KS((Tprime,Hprime),(Tprimeprime,Hprimeprime)). 
For computing the basic kernel for the extended trees, i.e. KS(1,2,c) we use the model algorithm presented by (Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) and refined by (Moschitti and Zanzotto, 2007) based on the algorithm for tree fragment feature 0 10 20 30 40 50 0 10 20 30 40 50 ms nm placeholders K(G1,G2) Kmax(G1,G2) Figure 7: Mean execution time in milliseconds (ms) of the two algorithms wrt.

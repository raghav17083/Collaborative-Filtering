A possible approach for representing paraphrases is that of Chandrasekar et al (1996) in the context of text simplification. 
Sentence simplification systems (Chandrasekar et al. , 1996; Mahesh, 1997; Carroll et al. , 1998; Grefenstette, 1998; Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2000) are capable of compressing long sentences by deleting unimportant words and phrases. 
(Chandrasekar et al. , 1996) discussed text simplification in general. 
Between these two extremes, there has been a relatively modest amount of work in sentence simplification (Chandrasekar, Doran, and Bangalore 1996; Mahesh 1997; Carroll et al. 1998; Grefenstette 1998; Jing 2000; Knight and Marcu 2002) and document compression (Daume III and Marcu 2002; Daume III and Marcu 2004; Zajic, Dorr, and Schwartz 2004) in which words, phrases, and sentences are selected in an extraction process. 
Supertagging before Parsing The output of the supertagger, an almost parse, has been used in a variety of applications including information retrieval (Chandrasekar and Srinivas 1997b, 1997c, 1997d) and information extraction (Doran et al. 1997), text simplification (Chandrasekar, Doran, and Srinivas 1996, Chandrasekar and Srinivas 1997a), and language modeling (Srinivas 1996) to illustrate that supertags provide an appropriate level of lexical description needed for most applications.

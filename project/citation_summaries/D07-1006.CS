However, except for (Fraser and Marcu, 2007b), none of these advances in alignment quality has improved translation quality of a state-of-the-art system. 
In the first set of experiments, we compare two settings of our UALIGN system with other aligners, GIZA++ (Union) (Och and Ney, 2003) and LEAF (with 2 iterations) (Fraser and Marcu, 2007). 
They propose two modifications to f-measure: varying the precision/recall tradeoff, and fully-connecting the alignment links before computing f-measure.11 Weighted Fully-Connected F-Measure Given a hypothesized set of alignment links H and a goldstandard set of alignment links G, we define H+ = fullyConnect(H) and G+ = fullyConnect(G), and then compute: f-measure(H+) = 1 precision(H+) + 1 recall(H+) For phrase-based Chinese-English and ArabicEnglish translation tasks, (Fraser and Marcu, 2007a) obtain the closest correlation between weighted fully-connected alignment f-measure and BLEU score using =0.5 and =0.1, respectively. 
The training data is aligned using the LEAF technique (Fraser and Marcu, 2007). 
1.2 Related Work Recently, discriminative methods for alignment have rivaled the quality of IBM Model 4 alignments (Liu et al., 2005; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005; Taskar et al., 2005; Moore et al., 2006; Fraser and Marcu, 2007b).

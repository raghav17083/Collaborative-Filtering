It is often argued that the ability to translate discontiguous phrases is important to modeling translation (Chiang, 2007; Simard et al., 2005; Quirk and Menezes, 2006), and it may be that this explains the results. 
However, it cannot handle long-distance reorderings properly and does not exploit discontinuous phrases and linguistically syntactic structure features (Quirk and Menezes, 2006). 
One of the theoretical problems with phrase based SMT models is that they can not effectively model the discontiguous translations and numerous attempts have been made on this issue (Simard et al., 2005; Quirk and Menezes, 2006; Wellington et al., 2006; Bod, 2007; Zhang et al., 2007). 
Also, slightly restating the advantages of phrase-pairs identified in (Quirk and Menezes, 2006), these blocks are effective at capturing context including the encoding of non-compositional phrase pairs, and capturing local reordering, but they lack variables (e.g. embedding between ne . . .pas in French), have sparsity problems, and lack a strategy for global reordering. 
This definition is similar to that of minimal translation units as described in Quirk and Menezes (2006), although they allow null words on either side.

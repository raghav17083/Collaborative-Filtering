The smoothing methods proposed in the literature (overviews are provided by Dagan, Lee, and Pereira (1999) and Lee (1999)) can be generally divided into three types: discounting (Katz 1987), class-based smoothing (Resnik 1993; Brown et al. 1992; 364 Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 3 Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993), and distance-weighted averaging (Grishman and Sterling 1994; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999). 
Several measures of distributional similarity have been proposed in the literature (Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999; Lee 1999). 
An example of the second approach evaluates the clusters by using them to smooth probability distributions (Lee and Pereira 1999). 
We chose the verb prediction task which is similar to other word prediction tasks (e.g. ,(Golding and Roth, 1999)) and, in particular, follows the paradigm in (Lee and Pereira, 1999; Dagan et al. , 1999; Lee, 1999). 
Dagan, Lee, and Pereira (1999) use perplexity to compare back-off smoothing against distance-weighted averaging methods within the context of language modeling for speech recognition and show that the latter outperform the former.

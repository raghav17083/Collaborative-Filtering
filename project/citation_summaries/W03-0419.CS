5 Experiments We used the same Chunking and English NER task data used for the shared tasks of CoNLL2000 (Sang and Buchholz, 2000) and CoNLL2003 (Sang and De Meulder, 2003), respectively. 
Most systems that participated in the CoNLL 2002 and 2003 shared tasks on named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) applied this model, as they modeled the identification of mention boundaries and the assignment of mention type at the same time. 
For the baseline method, we performed a conditional random field (CRF), which is exactly the same training procedure described in (Sha and Pereira, 2003) with L-BFGS. 
Sequential tagging with the BIO tag set has proven quite accurate for shallow parsing and named entity extraction tasks (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001; Sha and Pereira, 2003; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). 
It has been studied extensively in various domains, including the newswire (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) domain and more recently the biomedical domain (Blaschke et al. , 2004; Kim et al. , 2004).

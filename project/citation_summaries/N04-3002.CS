2 Computer-Human Dialogue Data Our data consists of student dialogues with ITSPOKE (Intelligent Tutoring SPOKEn dialogue system) (Litman and Silliman, 2004), a spoken dialogue tutor built on top of the Why2-Atlas conceptual physics text-based tutoring system (VanLehn et al. , 2002). 
2 The Dialogue System and Corpus We are currently building a spoken dialogue tutorial system called ITSPOKE (Intelligent Tutoring SPOKEn dialogue system) (Litman and Silliman, 2004), with the goal of automatically predicting and adapting to student emotions. 
3 Corpus For our study, we used an annotated corpus of 20 human-computer spoken dialogue tutoring sessions (for our work we use the ITSPOKE system (Litman and Silliman, 2004) which uses the textbased Why2-ATLAS dialogue tutoring system as its back-end (VanLehn et al. , 2002)). 
1 Introduction With recent advances in spoken dialogue system technologies, researchers have turned their attention to more complex domains (e.g. tutoring (Litman and Silliman, 2004; Pon-Barry et al. , 2006), technical support (Acomb et al. , 2007), medication assistance (Allen et al. , 2006)). 
2 ITSPOKE ITSPOKE (Litman and Silliman, 2004) is a stateof-the-art tutoring spoken dialogue system for conceptual physics.

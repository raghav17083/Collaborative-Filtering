The information put in the lexicon is thereby increased in both amount and complexity: see, for example, lexical rules in LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1983), GPSG (Gazdar, Klein, Pullum and Sag, 1985), HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1987), Combinatory Categorial Grammars (Steedman 1985, 1988), Karttunen's version of Categorial Grammar (Karttunen 1986, 1988), some versions of GB theory (Chomsky 1981), and Lexicon-Grammars (Gross 1984). 
As Gross (1984), we consider verbs, nouns, and adjectives as predicates yielding sentences. 
13 It has, however, frequently been observed that an idiomatic phrase should very rarely be interpreted nonidiomatically (Koller 1977, p. 13; Chafe 1968, p. 123; Gross 1984, p. 278; Swinney 1981, p. 208). 
The information put in the lexicon is thereby increased both in amount and complexity: for example, lexical rules in LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1983), GPSG (Gazdar, Klein, Pullum and Sag, 1985), HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1987), Comhinatory Categoriai Grammars (Steedman 1988), Karttunen's version of Categorial Grammar (Karttunen 1986, 1988), some versions of GB theory (Chomsky 1981), and LexiconGrammars (Gross 1984). 
There are at least two authors who have proposed its use: M. Gross (Gross, 1984) used it for coding the syntactic behavior of lexical items, hence the term lexicon-grammar, and G. Miller, the father of WN (Miller et al., 1990) suggested it to support lexical access.

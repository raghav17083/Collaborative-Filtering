Although the role hierarchy was expected to generalize semantic roles, no positive results for role classification have been reported (Baldewein et al., 2004). 
1 Introduction Clustering techniques have been used successfully for many natural language processing tasks, such as document clustering (Willett, 1988; Zamir and Etzioni, 1998; Cutting et al. , 1992; Vempala and Wang, 2005), word sense disambiguation (Shin and Choi, 2004), semantic role labeling (Baldewein et al. , 2004), pitch accent type disambiguation (Levow, 2006). 
Possible features include goodness of fit relative to pre-computed preferences (Baldewein et al. , 2004), named entities (Pradhan et al. , 2004), or broad ontological classes like animate or artifact. 
Recent NLP problems addressed by clustering include POS induction (Clark, 2003; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007), word sense disambiguation (Shin and Choi, 2004), semantic role labeling (Baldewein et al., 2004), pitch accent type disambiguation (Levow, 2006) and grammar induction (Klein, 2005). 
Our work suggests that feature generalization based on verb-similarity may compliment approaches to generalization based on role-similarity (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Baldewein et al. , 2004).

P06-1038:1	56:240	(Berland and Charniak, 1999) use hand crafted patterns to discover part-of (meronymy) relationships, and (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) discover various interesting relations between verbs.
---------------------------------------------------
W07-1425:2	32:188	According to the work of (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004; Torisawa, 2006), predicate phrase (simple sentence) is a reasonable unit because it approximately corresponds to the meaning of single event.
---------------------------------------------------
E09-3004:3	40:188	There is also a non-distributional strand of this approach: it uses Hearst-like patterns (Hearst, 1992) which are supposed to indicate the presence of two terms in a certain relation most often hyponymy or meronymy (see Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
P07-2047:4	35:148	2 Summarization Based on Event Term Clustering 2.1 Event Term Graph We introduce VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), a broad-coverage repository of semantic verb relations, into event-based summarization.
---------------------------------------------------
P07-2047:5	41:148	This is identified as the strongerthan relation in (Timothy and Patrick, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
P08-1090:6	48:258	Work on semantic similarity learning such as Chklovski and Pantel (2004) also automatically learns relations between verbs.
---------------------------------------------------
N06-3007:7	48:106	(Turney, 2001; Terra and Clarke, 2003; Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
P07-1057:8	176:202	The VerbOcean project (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) deals with relations between verbs.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1101:9	11:138	Additionally, a wide variety of relationship-specific classifiers have been proposed, including pattern-based classifiers for hyponyms (Hearst, 1992), meronyms (Girju, 2003), synonyms (Lin et al. , 2003), a variety of verb relations (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), and general purpose analogy relations (Turney et al. , 2003).
---------------------------------------------------
W07-2003:10	19:139	Chklovski and Pantel (2004) introduce a 5-class set, designed specifically for characterizing verb-verb semantic relations.
---------------------------------------------------
W06-0904:11	160:179	In particular, we could emulate the approach used in VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
P05-1016:12	14:208	For example, in VERBOCEAN (Chklovski and Pantel 2004), we find the verb relation to surpass is-stronger-than to hit, but it is not specified that it is the achieving sense of hit where this relation applies.
---------------------------------------------------
P05-1016:13	12:208	Ontologizing semantic resources Recently, researchers have applied textand web-mining algorithms for automatically creating lexical semantic resources like similarity lists (Lin 1998), semantic lexicons (Riloff and Shepherd 1997), hyponymy lists (Shinzato and Torisawa 2004; Pantel and Ravichandran 2004), partwhole lists (Girgu et al. 2003), and verb relation graphs (Chklovski and Pantel 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
W09-2415:14	115:179	More generally, semantic relation inventories attempt to generalize relations across wide groups of verbs (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and include relations that are not verbcentered (Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003; Moldovan et al., 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
H05-1049:15	102:196	 LSA Match: v and M(v) are distributionally similar according to a freely available Latent Semantic Indexing package,2 or for verbs similar according to VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
P05-1014:16	96:199	A few recent works (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Keller et al. , 2002; Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) used the web to collect statistics on word cooccurrences.
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1082:17	89:160	We choose VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) to obtain the relatedness between predicates (after using WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to change all the nominal predicates into verbs) and use WordNet for the argument alignment.
---------------------------------------------------
C08-1024:18	38:189	Typical target relations include Reaction and Production (Pantel and Pennacchiootti, 2006), person-affiliation and organization-location (Zelenko et al., 2002), part-whole (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Girju et al., 2006) and temporal precedence relations between events (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004; Torisawa, 2006).
---------------------------------------------------
P09-1031:19	59:255	Other types of relations that have been studied by pattern-based approaches include questionanswer relations (such as birthdates and inventor) (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), synonyms and antonyms (Lin et al., 2003), general purpose analogy (Turney et al., 2003), verb relations (including similarity, strength, antonym, enablement and temporal) (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), entailment (Szpektor et al., 2004), and more specific relations, such as purpose, creation (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007), LivesIn, and EmployedBy (Bunescu and Mooney , 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
H05-1077:20	15:186	Chklovski and Pantel (2004) address the automatic acquisition of verb-verb pairs and their relations from the web.
---------------------------------------------------
W05-1207:21	127:130	Some interesting and simple inter-sentential patters are defined in (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1028:22	40:250	Some studies deal with the discovery of more specific relation sub-types, including inter-verb relations (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and semantic relations between nominals (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008).
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1095:23	125:181	However, rather than hand-creating lexical rules and running into the same limitations as with GTags rules, we used an empiricallyderived resource called VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel 2004), available at http://semantics.isi.edu/ocean.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-2075:24	51:205	To obtain sufficient coverage, recent works such as (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) applied pattern-based approaches to the web.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-2075:25	96:205	1 Previously used by (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
P06-2075:26	45:205	Chklovski and Pantel (2004) used patterns to extract a set of relations between verbs, such as similarity, strength and antonymy.
---------------------------------------------------
N09-3014:27	38:162	First, some of the measures make use of WordNet relations (Fellbaum, 1998), and second, some use the temporal ordering provided by the happens-before relation in VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
P07-1030:28	38:200	In addition to these basic types, several studies deal with the discovery and labeling of more specific relation sub-types, including inter-verb relations (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and nouncompound relationships (Moldovan et al, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
N06-1008:29	161:225	MI is a score based onmutual information androughly corresponds to the score used in a previous attempt to acquire temporal relations between events (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
N06-1008:30	24:225	Inaddition, research has also been done on the acquisition of the temporal relations (Fujiki et al. , 2003; Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) by using coordinated sentences as we did, but these worksdid not consider the implications between events.
---------------------------------------------------
P08-1079:31	51:269	Work was also done on relations between verbs (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
P08-1079:32	74:269	For more specific lexical relationships like relationships between verbs (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), nominals (Girju et al., 2004; Girju et al., 2007) or meronymy subtypes (Berland and Charniak, 1999) there is still little agreement which important relationships should be defined.
---------------------------------------------------
P08-1079:33	246:269	30 relations are noun compound relationships as proposed in the (Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003) classification scheme, and 5 relations are verb-verb relations proposed by (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
P08-1079:34	79:269	Hence, when exploring very specific relationship types or very generic, but not widely accepted, types (like verb strength), many researchers resort to manual human-based evaluation (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
P08-1079:35	257:269	These lists included patterns expressing hypernymy (Hearst, 1992; Pantel et al., 2004), meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Girju et al., 2006), synonymy (Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006), and verb strength + verb happensbefore (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
W09-1701:36	58:235	The work on VerbOcean is similar to our research in the use of the Web for acquiring relationships (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
P08-1118:37	84:253	Additionally, little external information is needed to gain broad coverage of antonymy, negation, and numeric mismatch contradictions; each involves only a closed set of words or data that can be obtained using existing resources and techniques (e.g., WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004)).
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1107:38	249:249	As implicitly experimented in (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), some beneficial effect can be obtained combining these non-distributional methods with the methods based on the Distributional Hypothesis.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1107:39	106:249	The overall procedure to verify if an entailment between two verbs (vt,vh) holds in a pointwise assertion is: whenever it is possible to apply the agentive nominalization to the hypothesis vh, scan the corpus to detect those expressions in which the agentified hypothesis verb is the subject of a clause governed by the text verb vt. Given a verb pair (vt,vh) the assertion is for851 Lexico-syntactic patterns nominalization Pnom(vt,vh) = {agent(vh)|num:sing vt|person:third,t:pres, agent(vh)|num:plur vt|person:nothird,t:pres, agent(vh)|num:sing vt|t:past, agent(vh)|num:plur vt|t:past} happens-before (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) Phb(vt,vh) = {vh|t:inf and then vt|t:pres, vh|t:inf * and then vt|t:pres, vh|t:past and then vt|t:pres, vh|t:past * and then vt|t:pres, vh|t:inf and later vt|t:pres, vh|t:past and later vt|t:pres, vh|t:inf and subsequently vt|t:pres, vh|t:past and subsequently vt|t:pres, vh|t:inf and eventually vt|t:pres, vh|t:past and eventually vt|t:pres} probabilistic entailment (Glickman et al. , 2005) Ppe(vt,vh) = {vh|person:third,t:pres  vt|person:third,t:pres, vh|t:past  vt|t:past, vh|t:pres cont  vt|t:pres cont, vh|person:nothird,t:pres  vt|person:nothird,t:pres} additional sets Fagent(v) = {agent(v)|num:sing,agent(v)|num:plur} F(v) = {v|person:third,t:present, v|person:nothird,t:present,v|t:past} Fall(v) = {v|person:third,t:pres,v|t:pres cont, v|person:nothird,t:present,v|t:past} Table 1: Nominalization and related textual entailment lexico-syntactic patterns malized in a set of textual entailment lexicosyntactic patterns, that we call nominalized patterns Pnom(vt,vh).
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1107:40	155:249	As in our work, also in (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), a mutualinformation-related measure is used as statistical indicator.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1107:41	134:249	The measure Snom(vt,vh) indicates the relatedness between two elements composing a pair, in line with (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004; Glickman et al. , 2005) (see Sec.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1107:42	153:249	1 reports the happens-before lexico-syntactic patterns (Phb) as proposed in (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1107:43	140:249	We focus on two methods proposed in (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and (Glickman et al. , 2005).
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1107:44	144:249	Even if, as discussed in (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), these patterns are not specifically defined as entailment detectors, they can be useful for this purpose.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1107:45	154:249	In contrast to what is done in (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) we decided to directly count patterns derived from different verbal forms and not to use an estimation factor.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1107:46	143:249	The lexico-syntactic patterns introduced in (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) have been developed to detect six kinds of verb relations: similarity, strength, antonymy, enablement, and happensbefore.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1107:47	148:249	3): the entailed verb vh precedes the entailing verb vt. One set of lexical patterns in (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) seems to capture the same idea: the happens-before (hb) patterns.
---------------------------------------------------
N06-1007:48	27:184	In (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) different types of semantic relations between verbs are discovered using surface patterns (like X-ed by Y-ing for enablement1, which would match obtained by borrowing, for example) and assessing the strength of asymmetric relations as mutual information between the two verbs.
---------------------------------------------------
N06-1007:49	36:184	Pattern-matching often imposes restrictions on the syntactic configurations in which the verbs can appear in the corpus: the patterns employed by (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and (Torisawa, 2003) derive pairs of only those verbs that have identical argument structures, and often only those that involve a subject and a direct object.
---------------------------------------------------
N06-1007:50	33:184	However, this approach is likely to pick only a particular kind of verb entailment, that of troponymy (such as 1In (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) enablement is defined to be a relation where one event often, but not necessarily always, gives rise to the other event, which coincides with our definition of entailment (see Section 3).
---------------------------------------------------
W09-1111:51	53:236	In computational linguistics, our pattern discovery procedure extends over previous approaches that use surface patterns as indicators of semantic relations between nouns or verbs ((Hearst, 1998; Chklovski and Pantel, 2004; Etzioni et al., 2004; Turney, 2006; Davidov and Rappoport, 2008) inter alia).
---------------------------------------------------
W05-0101:52	103:202	After building the chunker, students were asked to 4 choose a verb and then analyze verb-argument structure (they were provided with two relevant papers (Church and Hanks, 1990; Chklovski and Pantel, 2004)).

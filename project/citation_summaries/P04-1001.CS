The data collected from our previous user studies were used in our evaluation (Chai et al. , 2004b). 
Currently, we calculate the weight depending on the temporal distance as follows: )(] 2000 )( exp[)( in in tt tt tt g in   = (2) Equation (2) indicates that at a given time t n (measured in milliseconds), the closer a gesture (at t i ) is to the time t n, the higher impact this gesture has on the salience distribution (Chai et al. , 2004b). 
Our previous work (Chai et al. , 2004b) also showed that 85% of time gestures occurred before corresponding speech units. 
Therefore, in Equation (1), is the selection probability which indicates the likelihood of selecting an entity e given a gesture at time t i . This selection probability is calculated by a function of the distance between the location of the entity and the focus point of the recognized gesture on the display (Chai et al. , 2004a).

In this section, we relate our approach to the HPSG based approach presented in [Carroll et al. , 1999], to the statistical and semi-statistical strategies used in [Bangalore and Rambow, 2000] and in [White, 2004] and to the constraint based approach described in [Koller and Striegnitz, 2002]. 
Because XDG allows us to write grammars with completely free word order, XDG solving is an NPcomplete problem (Koller and Striegnitz, 2002). 
Strategies that have been introduced to reduce the search space in integrated systems include greedy/incremental search algorithms (Stone et al., 2003), constructing a dependency graph for a flat semantic input and converting it into a derivation tree (Koller and Striegnitz, 2002), using planning algorithms (Appelt, 1985; Koller and Stone, 2007), polarity filtering (Kow, 2007) and using underspecified g-derivation trees (G-TAG, Danlos (2000)). 
7.3 Koller et al.s constraint-based approach Finally, our approach has interesting connections to the constraint-based approach proposed by [Koller and Striegnitz, 2002]. 
Because XDG allows us to write grammars with completely free word order, XDG solving is an NP-complete problem (Koller and Striegnitz, 2002).

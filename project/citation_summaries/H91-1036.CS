In earlier work (Moore and Dowding, 1991), we showed that approximately 80% of the edges built in an allpaths bottom-up parser contained gaps, and that it is possible to use prediction in a bottom-up parser only to constrain the gap categories, without requiring prediction for nongapped categories. 
Moore and Dowding (1991) observed a ninefold increase ill time required to parse sentences with a straightforward C, KY parser as opposed to a shift-reduce parser. 
In previous work (Moore and Dowding, 1991), we compared limited left-context checking to some other methods for dealing with empty categories in a bottom-up parser. 
CONCLUSIONS The research reported is in a similar vein to that of, for example, Moore & Dowding (1991), Samuelsson & Rayner (1991), and Maxwell & Kaplan (1993), in that it relies on empirical results for the study and optimisation of parsing algorithms rather than on traditional techniques of complexity analysis. 
It includes modular syntactic and semantic components, integrated into an efficient all-paths bottom-up parser (Moore and Dowding, 1991).

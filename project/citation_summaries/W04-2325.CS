Section 3 describes the results we obtained by applying the classification scheme of Rodriguez and Schlangen (2004) to the Communicator Corpus (Bennett and Rudnicky, 2002). 
They are partial declaratives with rising boundary tone, that either reformulate (7.1%) the problematic utterance, repeat 4Declarative questions cover all cases of non-interrogative word-order, i.e., both declarative sentences and fragments (Rodriguez and Schlangen, 2004). 
2.2 Rodriguez and Schlangen (R&S) Rodriguez and Schlangen (2004) devised a multidimensional classification scheme where form and 1Alternative questions would be interpreted as asking a polar question with an exclusive reading. 
As noted by (Rodriguez and Schlangen, 2004), PGH provide no feature to describe the extent to which an RF repeats the problematic utterance. 
S is proposing activity  L is considering proposal  Intention S is signalling that p L is recognizing that p Signal S is presenting signal  L is identifying signal  Channel S is executing behavior  L is attending to behavior  Table 1: Four levels of grounding Schlangen, 2004).

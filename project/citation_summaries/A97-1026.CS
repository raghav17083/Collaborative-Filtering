Other potential uses of these algorithms include better language modeling by building topic-based language models, improving NLP algorithms (e.g. coreference resolution), summarization, hypertext linking (Salton and Buckley, 1992), automated essay grading (Burstein et al. , 1997) and topic detection and tracking (TDT program committee, 1998).

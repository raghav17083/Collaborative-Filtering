Recently, [Roth and Yih, 2004] applied an ILP model to the task of the simultaneous assignment of semantic roles to the entities mentioned in a sentence and recognition of the relations holding between them. 
5 Integer Linear Programming Approach As noted in the introduction, we model our task as global, constraint-based inference over the separately trained entity and relation classifiers, and implement the inference procedure as binary integer linear programming (ILP) ((Roth and Yih, 2004), (Punyakanok et al. , 2004)). 
This includes parsing and relation extraction (Miller et al. , 2000), entity labeling and relation extraction (Roth and Yih, 2004), and part-of-speech tagging and chunking (Sutton et al. , 2004). 
We take a similar approach that has been previously used for entity/relation recognition (Roth and Yih, 2004), and model this inference procedure as solving an ILP.

Jing and McKeown (1999; 2000) found that human summarization can be traced back to six cut-andpaste operations of a text and proposed a revision method consisting of sentence reduction and combination modules with a sentence extraction part. 
al., 1994), compression of sentences with Automatic Translation approaches (Knight and Marcu, 2000), Hidden Markov Model (Jing and McKeown, 2000), Topic Signatures based methods (Lin and Hovy, 2000, Lacatusu et al., 2006) are among the most popular techniques that have been used in the summarization systems of this category. 
Automatic text summarization approaches have offered reasonably well-performing approximations for identifiying important sentences (Lin and Hovy, 2002; Schiffman et al., 2002; Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Daume III and Marcu, 2006) but, not surprisingly, text (re)generation has been a major challange despite some work on sub-sentential modification (Jing and McKeown, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2000; Barzilay and McKeown, 2005). 
We analyzed a set of articles and identified six major operations that can be used for editing the extracted sentences, including removing extraneous phrases from an extracted sentence, combining a reduced sentence with other sentences, syntactic transformation, substituting phrases in an extracted sentence with their paraphrases, substituting phrases with more general or specific descriptions, and reordering the extracted sentences (Jing and McKeown, 1999; Jing and McKeown, 2000).

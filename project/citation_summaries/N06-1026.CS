4.1 Kim-Hovy method and improvements Kim and Hovy (2006) enrich their sentiment lexicon from WordNet as follows. 
Much of the work in subjectivity analysis has been applied to English data, though work on other languages is growing: e.g., Japanese data are used in (Kobayashi et al., 2004; Suzuki et al., 2006; Takamura et al., 2006; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006), Chinese data are used in (Hu et al., 2005), and German data are used in (Kim and Hovy, 2006). 
In fact, researchers in sentiment analysis have realized benefits by decomposing the problem into S/O and polarity classification (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2006). 
A simple but high-precision method proposed by Kim and Hovy (2006) is to add all synonyms of a polar word with the same polarity and its antonyms with reverse polarity. 
While work on subjectivity analysis in other languages is growing (e.g. , Japanese data are used in (Takamura et al. , 2006; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006), Chinese data are used in (Hu et al. , 2005), and German data are used in (Kim and Hovy, 2006)), much of the work in subjectivity analysis has been applied to English data.

(2005), Nakov and Hearst (2005)), similarity-based approaches incorporating orthographical, morpho-syntactic, and syntactic similarity criteria (e.g., Agarwal and Boggess (1992), Okumura and Muraki (1994)), as well as a combination of distribution information and syntactic criteria (Hogan, 2007a). 
Nakov and Hearst (2005) examined the use of web-based n-gram frequencies for an NLP task and concluded that these issues do not greatly impact the interpretation of the results. 
He demonstrated the effectiveness of semantic similarity calculated from a large text collection, and agreement of numbers between n 1 and n 2 and between n 1 and n 3 . Nakov and Hearst (2005) collected web-based statistics with search engines and applied them to a task similar to Resniks. Hogan (2007) improved the parsing accuracy of sentences in which coordinated noun phrases are known to exist.

Web-based statistics have also had an impact on these wider analysis tasks, including work on interpretation of verb nominalisations (Nicholson and Baldwin, 2006) and NC coordination (Nakov and Hearst, 2005b).

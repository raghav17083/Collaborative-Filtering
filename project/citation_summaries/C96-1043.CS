As regards evaluation, NLG systems have been evaluated e.g. by using human judges to assess the quality of the texts produced (Coch, 1996; Lester and Porter, 1997; Harvey and Carberry, 1998); by comparing the systems performance to that of humans (Yeh and Mellish, 1997); or through task efficacy measures, i.e., measuring how well the users so, and the distribution of topics and of evaluations is too broad to be telling. 
The method for natural language generation implemented in D2S is hybrid in nature (Reiter, 1995); (Coch, 1996). 
 ALETHGEN takes data from a customer database and produces a customised letter (in French) (Coch, 1996). 
Coch (1996) and Lester and Porter (1997) have compared NLG texts to humanwritten and (in Coch's case) mail-merge texts, but the comparisons were judgements by human domain experts, they did not measure the actual impact of the texts on users. 
for generating from this content textual output in several languages simultaneously (see (Power and Scott, 1998; Hartley and Paris, 1997; Coch, 1996)).

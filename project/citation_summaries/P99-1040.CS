However, this process often fails, as there is no simple one-to-one mapping between low confidence scores and incorrect recognitions, and the setting of a rejection threshold is a matter of trial and error (Bouwman et al. , 1999). 
In addition, previous research (Litman, Walker, and Kearns 1999; Walker et al. 2000) has shown that features of the dialogue as a whole and features of more local context can be helpful in predicting problematic dialogues. 
It has shown that during human machine dialog, there are sufficient cues for machines to automatically identify error conditions (Levow, 1998; Litman et al. , 1999; Hirschberg et al. , 2001; Walker et al. , 2002).

That corrections are difficult for ASR systems is generally explained by the fact that they tend to be hyperarticulatedhigher, louder, longerthan other turns (Wade, Shriberg, and Price 1992; Oviatt et al. 1996; Levow 1998; Bell and Gustafson 1999; Shimojima, et al. 2001; Soltau and Waibel 1998, 2000; Soltau, Metze, and Waibel 2002), where ASR models are not well adapted to handle this special speaking style, although recent studies suggest that ASR systems are becoming less vulnerable to hyperarticulation (Bulyko et al. 2005).

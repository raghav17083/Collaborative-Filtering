Moreover, there have been also efforts to extend the use of HMMs to word sense disambiguation (Segond et al 1997) and shallow/full parsing (Brants et al 1997; Skut et al 1998; Zhou et al 2000).

However, in (Segond et al. , 1997) the tagset is used differently, by defining equivalence classes of words with the same set of senses. 
grained distinctions of WN (Hearst and Schutze, 1993) (Peters et al. , 1998) (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001) (Agirre et al. , 2003) and on using predefined sets of sense-groupings for learning class-based classifiers for WSD (Segond et al. , 1997) (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003) (Villarejo et al. , 2005) (Curran, 2005) (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006). 
WordNet has been used in numerous natural language processing, such as part of speech tagging (Segond et al. , 97), word sense disambiguation (Resnik, 1995), text categorization (Gomez-Hidalgo and Rodriguez, 1997), information extraction (Chai and Biermann, 1997), and so on with considerable success.

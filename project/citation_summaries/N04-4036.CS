In recent years, NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004a) has provided a set of about 200,000 manually annotated instances of nominalizations with arguments, giving rise to supervised machinelearned approaches such as (Pradhan et al., 2004) and (Liu and Ng, 2007), which perform fairly well in the overall task of classifying deverbal arguments. 
A wide range of features have been shown to be useful in previous work on semantic role labeling for verbal predicates (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al. , 2004b; Xue and Palmer, 2004) and our experiments show most of them are also effective for SRL of nominalized predicates. 
So far we are aware of only one English NomBank-based SRL system (Jiang and Ng, 2006), which uses the maximum entropy classifier, although similar efforts are reported on the Chinese NomBank by (Xue, 2006) 208 and on FrameNet by (Pradhan et al. , 2004) using a small set of hand-selected nominalizations.

The same 1A follow-up project, NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004), has since provided annotations for nominal instances, too.

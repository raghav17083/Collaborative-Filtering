Bound variable anaphora, on the other hand, involves replacement of the a_term by a variable bound by a logical form quantifier (Partee 1978).


Phl) thesis, Harvard University PARTEE, Barbara Hall (1978).


In recent research into anaphora the term "reference" has been used in three different senses ( Szwedek, 1981): (a) as a relation between the name and the thing named (Hall Partee, 1978) (b) as an association between noun phrases and mental entities in the language user's (Nash-%~ebber, 1978) (c) as an association between the occurrence of phrases in the text (Reinhart, 1981) However the reference is understood, irl order to interpret correctly anaphora on the semantic level ((a) and (b)), first a stage (C) is necessary.

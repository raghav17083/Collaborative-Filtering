This is due to the fact that V-measure considers as the worst solution in terms of completeness the one, in which each class is represented by every cluster, and specifically with a distribution equal to the distribution of cluster sizes (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007). 
3 The V and VI Measures The V (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) and VI (Meila, 2007) measures are IT based measures. 
These two limitations define the matching problem of F-Score (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) which can lead to: (1) identical scores between different clustering solutions, and (2) inaccurate assessment of the clustering quality. 
Recently, two measures have been proposed that avoid many of the weaknesses of previous measures and exhibit several attractive properties (see Sections 2 and 3): the VI measure (Meila, 2007) and the V measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007). 
V-measure assesses the quality of a clustering solution by explicitly measuring its homogeneity and its completeness (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007).

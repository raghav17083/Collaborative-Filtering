In these experiments, we used the grammar of the Delphi component from BBN's HARC system (Stallard 1989), which combines syntax and semantics in a unification formalism.


Our own natural language database query systems, JANUS (Weischedel et al. 1989), ParlanceTM, 1 and Delphi (Stallard 1989), have used these techniques quite successfully.

3 A corpus analysis of discourse markers 3.1 Materials We used previous work on cue phrases (Halliday and Hasan, 1976; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Martin, 1992; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Knott, 1995; Fraser, 1996) to create an initial set of more than 450 potential discourse markers. 
Hirschberg and Litman (1993) and Knott (1996) have identified sets of cue phrases. 
3.1 Domain-specific Cue Phrases Many discourse segmentation techniques (e.g. Hirschberg and Litman, 1993) as well as some topic segmentation algorithms rely on cue words and phrases (e.g. Beeferman et al. , 1997), but the types of cue words used vary greatly. 
et al (1992) Hirschberg and Litman (1993), Vander Linden and Martin (1995), Knott (1996) and Litman (1996)). 
3 SIFAS System Architecture From the perspective of discourse analysis, the study of discourse markers basically involves four distinct but fundamental issues: 1) the occurrence and the frequency of occurrence of discourse markers (Moser and Moore 1995), 2) determining whether a candidate linguistic item is a discourse marker (identification / disambiguation) (Hirschberg and Litman 1993; Siegel and McKeown 1994), 3) determination or selection of the discourse function of an identified discourse marker (Moser and Moore 1995), and 4) the coverage capabilities (in terms of levels of embedding) among rhetorical relations, as well as among individual discourse markers.

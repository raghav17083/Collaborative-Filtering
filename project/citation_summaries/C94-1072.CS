W08-1002:1	13:101	Developed initially for the PAGE development and processing platform (Uszkoreit et al., 1994), the grammar has subsequently been ported to LKB (Copestake, 2001) and Pet (Callmeier, 2000) by Stefan Muller.
---------------------------------------------------
W02-1508:2	34:85	The [incr tsdb()] environment builds on the following components and modules: test and reference data stored with annotations in a structured database; annotations can range from minimal information (unique test item identifier, item origin, length et al.) to fine-grained linguistic classifications (e.g. regarding grammaticality and linguistic phenomena presented in an item), as they are represented in the TSNLP test suites, for example (Oepen, Netter, & Klein, 1997); tools to browse the available data, identify suitable subsets and feed them through the analysis component of processing systems like the LKB and PET, LiLFeS (Makino, Yoshida, Torisawa, & Tsujii, 1998), TRALE (Penn, 2000), PAGE (Uszkoreit et al. , 1994), and others; the ability to gather a multitude of precise and fine-grained (grammar) competence and (system) performance measureslike the number of readings obtained per test item, various time and memory usage statistics, ambiguity and non-determinism metrics, and salient properties of the result structuresand store them in a uniform, platform-independent data format as a competence and performance profile; and graphical facilities to inspect the resulting profiles, analyze system competence (i.e. grammatical coverage and overgeneration) and performance (e.g. cpu time and memory usage, parser search space, constraint solver  & $ % Parser 3Parser 2Parser 1Grammar 3Grammar 2Grammar 1 TestSet 3TestSet 2Test Set 1 ParallelVirtualMachine C and Lisp APIRelational DBMSBatch ControlStatisticsUserInterfaceANSI CCommon-LispTcl/Tk Figure 1: Rough sketch of [incr tsdb()] architecture: the core engine comprises the database management, batch control and statistics component, and the user interface.

W02-1502:3	90:140	Several other platforms exist which can efficiently parse text using the existing grammars, including the PET system developed in C ++ at Saarland University (Germany) and the DFKI (Callmeier, 2000); the PAGE system developed in Lisp at the DFKI (Uszkoreit et al. , 1994); the LiLFeS system developed at Tokyo University (Makino, Yoshida, Torisawa, & Tsujii, 1998), and a parallel processing system developed in Objective C at Delft University (The Netherlands; van Lohuizen, 2002).
---------------------------------------------------
J99-1002:4	431:803	The ERG itself has been developed without making use of defaults up to this point, using the DISCO/PAGE system (Uszkoreit et al. 1994), but it also runs within the LKB system (Copestake 1992).
---------------------------------------------------
P99-1061:5	15:278	We have implemented our methods as extensions to a HPSG grammar development environment (Uszkoreit et al. , 1994) which employs a sophisticated typed feature formalism (Krieger and Sch~ifer, 1994; Krieger and Sch~ifer, 1995) and an advanced agenda-based bottom-up chart parser (Kiefer and Scherf, 1996).
---------------------------------------------------
A97-1006:6	40:263	Within the HPSG-based approach to grammar description adopted for the early system (Uszkoreit et al. , 1994), achieving these goals turned out to be difficult.

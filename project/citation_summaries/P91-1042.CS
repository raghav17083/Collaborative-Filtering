The actual algorithm used in the system is optimized using several different techniques to minimize copying and to behave as efficiently as a pattern-matcher in cases when one of the feature structures subsumes the other (Emele 1991). 
An interpreter for the TFS rewrite machine has been implemented at the University of Stuttgart by Martin Emele and the author and has been used to test several linguistic models such as DCG, LFG, HPSG, and SFG \[Emele and Zajac 1990b; Emele et al. 1990; Zajac 1990a; Bateman and Momma 1991\]. 
One approach to this problem is to refine parsing algorithms by developing techniques such as restrictions, structure-sharing, and lazy unification that reduce the amount of structure that is stored and hence the need for copying of features structures (Shieber, 1985; Pereira, 1985; Karttunen and Kay, 1985; Wroblewski, 1987; Gerdemann, 1989; Godden, 1990; Kogure, 1990; Emele, 1991; Tomabechi, 1991; Harrison and Ellison, 1992)). 
14 For example, the use in the current implementation of several techniques adapted from PROLOG implementations such as structure sharing, chronological dereferencing (Emele 1991) and last call optimization, have improved efficiency by several orders of magnitude over previous "naive" implementations.

Following recent work on using dependency parsing in systems that identify protein interactions in biomedical text (Erkan et al., 2007; Stre et al., 2007; Katrenko and Adriaans, 2006), we have built a system for PPI extraction that uses dependency relations as features. 
While this task is traditionally performed using supervised algorithms such as support vector machines (Erkan et al., 2007), we show that RD is capable of achieving similar levels of precision without any manually annotated training data. 
For further improvement, we need to analyze the cause 128 positive all P R F AUC SVM-CW 1,000 5,834 60.0 71.9 65.2 89.3 L2-SVM 1,000 5,834 62.7 66.6 64.2 89.1 (Miwa et al., 2008) 1,005 5,648 60.4 69.3 64.2 (61.5) 87.9 (87.1) (Miyao et al., 2008) 1,059 5,648 54.9 65.5 59.5 (Airola et al., 2008) 1,000 5,834 52.9 61.8 56.4 84.8 (Stre et al., 2007) 1,068 5,631 64.3 44.1 52.0 (Erkan et al., 2007) 951 4,020 59.6 60.7 60.0 (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) 65.0 46.4 54.2 Table 5: Comparison with previous PPI extraction results on the AIMed corpus. 
Dependency tree paths between protein pairs have successfully been used to identify 112 protein interactions (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Erkan et al., 2007). 
To do so, we follow the same procedure and data sets used to evaluate semi-supervised classification of PPI sentences (Erkan et al., 2007).

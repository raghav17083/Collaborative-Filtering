(2008a) propose a tree sequence-based tree to tree translation model and Zhang et al. 
1 Introduction Recently linguistically-motivated syntax-based translation method has achieved great success in statistical machine translation (SMT) (Galley et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006, 2007; Zhang et al., 2007, 2008a; Mi et al., 2008; Mi and Huang 2008; Zhang et al., 2009). 
2 We illustrate the rule extraction with an example from the tree-to-tree translation model based on tree sequence alignment (Zhang et al, 2008a) without losing of generality to most syntactic tree based models. 
Nevertheless, the generated rules are strictly required to be derived from the contiguous translational equivalences (Galley et al, 2006; Marcu et al, 2006; Zhang et al, 2007, 2008a, 2008b; Liu et al, 2006, 2007). 
Motivated by the fact that non-syntactic phrases make non-trivial contribution to phrase-based SMT, the tree sequencebased translation model is proposed (Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008a) that uses tree sequence as the basic translation unit, rather than using single sub-tree as in the STSG.

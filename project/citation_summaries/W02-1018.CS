3.3 Phrases from Phrase Alignments Marcu and Wong [2002] proposed a translation model that assumes that lexical correspondences can be established not only at the word level, but at the phrase level as well. 
Marcu and Wong (2002) present a joint probability model for phrase-based translation. 
Och et al. [1999]s alignment template model can be reframed as a phrase translation system; Yamada and Knight [2001] use phrase translation in a syntaxbased translation system; Marcu and Wong [2002] introduced a joint-probability model for phrase translation; and the CMU and IBM word-based statistical machine translation systems1 are augmented with phrase translation capability. 
2.1 Generative Model Description We first describe the symmetric joint model of Marcu and Wong (2002), which we will extend. 
On the other hand, models that deal with structures or phrases instead of single words have also been proposed: the syntax translation models are described in (Yamada and Knight, 2001), alignment templates are used in (Och, 2002), and the alignment template approach is re-framed into the so-called phrase based translation (PBT) in (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Zens et al. , 2002; Koehn et al. , 2003; Tomas and Casacuberta, 2003).

The key to this algorithm is the use of structure sharing techniques similar to those used to process I_lG efficiently (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993). 
However, we know that derivations in TAGs are context-free (see (Vijay-Shanker, 1987)) and (VijayShanker and Weir, 1993) exhibits a CFG which represents all possible derivation sequences in a TAG. 
The complexity results carry over to linear indexed grammars, combinatory categorial grammars, and head grammars, since these formalisms are equivalent to TAGs (Vijay-Shanker and Weir 1993, 1994). 
It is known to be computationally tractable but less efficient than the polynomial time CCG algorithm of Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1993). 
In (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993), the contextfreeness of adjunction in TAGs is captured by giving a CFG to represent the set of all possible derivation sequences.

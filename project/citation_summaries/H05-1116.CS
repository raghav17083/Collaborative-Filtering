Researchers have further shown that opinion-oriented information extraction can provide analogous benefits to a variety of practical applications including product reputation tracking (Morinaga et al. , 2002), opinion-oriented question answering (Stoyanov et al. , 2005), and opinion-oriented summarization (e.g. Cardie et al. 
Researchers (Stoyanov et al., 2005) have found that opinion questions have very different characteristics when compared with fact-based questions: opinion questions are often much longer, more likely to represent partial answers rather than complete answers and vary much more widely. 
Also as shown in (Stoyanov et al., 2005), directly applying previous systems designed for fact-based QA onto opinion QA tasks would not achieve good performances. 
Recent work has shown the importance of recognizing such perspectivization of information for several NLP applications, such as information extraction, summarization, question answering (Wiebe et al. , 2004; Stoyanov et al. , 2005; Riloff et al. , 2005) and generation (Prasad et al. , 2005). 
and question answering (e.g. , (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Stoyanov et al. , 2005)).

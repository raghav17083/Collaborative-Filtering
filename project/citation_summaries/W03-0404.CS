5 Related Work Evidence from the surrounding context has been used previously to determine if the current sentence should be subjective/objective (Riloff et al., 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004)) and adjacency pair information has been used to predict congressional votes (Thomas et al., 2006). 
(Riloff et al., 2003) applied bootstrapping to recognise subjective noun keywords and classify sentences as subjective or objective in newswire texts. 
So far, research in automatic opinion recognition has primarily addressed learning subjective language (Wiebe et al. , 2004; Riloff et al. , 2003), identifying opinionated documents (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003) and sentences (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Riloff et al. , 2003), and discriminating between positive and negative language (Pang et al. , 2002; Morinaga et al. , 2002; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Turney and Littman, 2003; Dave et al. , 2003; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Wilson et al. , 2005).

We convert it into a corpus of subjective and objective sentencesfollowingexactlytheapproachin(Riloff et al., 2003; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) and obtain 6127 subjective and 4985 objective sentences respectively.

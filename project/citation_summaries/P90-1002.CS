Non-textualfeaturesfortopicsegmentation Research on non-textual features for topic segmentation has primarily focused on prosody, under the assumption that a key prosodic function is to mark structure at the discourse level (Steedman, 1990; Grosz and Hirshberg, 1992; Swerts, 1997). 
As noted above, syntactic constituency information is generally considered a good predictor of phrasing information (Gee and Grosjean, 1983; Selkirk, 1984; Marcus and Hindle, 1985; Steedman, 1990). 
5.3 PP ATTACHMENT (Steedman 1990 & Cruttenden 1986) observed that intonational structure is strongly constrained by meaning. 
Moreover, the analysis retains rather conventional notions of syntactic constituency, eschewing the nonstandard syntactic constituents advocated by Prevost and Steedman (1993), Steedman (1990; 1991). 
While most interest in boundary prediction has been focussed on synthesis (Gee and Grosjean, 1983; Bachenko and Fitzpatrick, 1990), currently there is considerable interest in predicting boundaries to aid recognition (Ostendoff et al. , 1990; Steedman, 1990).

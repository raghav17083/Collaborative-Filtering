In order to obtain CCG derivations for all sentences in the ACE corpus, we used the CCG parser introduced in (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002)3. 
In this paper we use the dependency model, which requires sets of predicate-argument dependencies for training.1 1Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002) describe a generative model of normal-form derivations; one possibility for training this model on partial data, which has not been explored, is to use the EM algorithm (Pereira and Schabes, 1992). 
1 Introduction Parsers have been developed for a variety of grammar formalisms, for example HPSG (Toutanova et al. , 2002; Malouf and van Noord, 2004), LFG (Kaplan et al. , 2004; Cahill et al. , 2004), TAG (Sarkar and Joshi, 2003), CCG (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002; Clark and Curran, 2004b), and variants of phrase-structure grammar (Briscoe et al. , 2006), including the phrase-structure grammar implicit in the Penn Treebank (Collins, 2003; Charniak, 2000). 
3 The Parser A number of statistical parsers have recently been developed for CCG (Clark et al. , 2002; Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002b; Clark and Curran, 2004b). 
We have argued that a model of the kind proposed in this paper is essential for parsing languages with freer word order, such as Dutch or Czech, where the model of Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002b) (and other models of surface dependencies) would systematically capture the wrong dependencies, even if only local dependencies are taken into account.

(2007) observe that their predominant sense method is not performing as well for 3We use the Lesk (overlap) similarity as implemented by the WordNet::similarity package (Pedersen et al., 2004). 
We use eight similarity measures implemented within the WordNet::Similarity package5, described in (Pedersen et al. , 2004); these include three measures derived from the paths between the synsets in WordNet: HSO (Hirst and St-Onge, 1998), LCH (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998), and WUP (Wu and Palmer, 1994); three measures based on information content: RES (Resnik, 1995), LIN (Lin, 1998), and JCN (Jiang and Conrath, 1997); the gloss-based Extended Lesk Measure LESK, (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003), and finally the gloss vector similarity measure VECTOR (Patwardan, 2003). 
The system uses WordNet-based 1http://senserelate.sourceforge.net measures of semantic relatedness2 (Pedersen et al. , 2004) to measure the relatedness between the different senses of the target word and the words in its context. 
We enrich the semantic information available to the classifier by using semantic similarity measures based on the WordNet taxonomy (Pedersen et al. , 2004). 
In addition, we use the measure from Resnik (1995), which is computed using an intrinsic information content measure relying on the hierarchical structure of the category tree (Seco et al. , 2004).

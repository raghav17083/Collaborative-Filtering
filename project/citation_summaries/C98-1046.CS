VN is built on a refinement of the Levin classes, the intersective Levin classes (Dang et al., 1998), aimed at achieving more coherent classes both semantically and syntactically. 
This constraint of having the same semantic roles is further ensured inside the VerbNet lexicon that is constructed based on a more refined version of the Levin classification called Intersective Levin classes (Dang et al. , 1998). 
A very good candidate seems to be the Intersective Levin class (ILC) (Dang et al. , 1998) that can be found as well in other predicate resources like PB and VerbNet (VN) (Kipper et al. , 2000). 
3) Regular Polysemy: Several clusters were produced which represent linguistically plausible intersective classes (e.g. A3) (Dang et al. , 1998) rather than single classes. 
This constraint of having the same semantic roles is further ensured inside the VN lexicon which is constructed based on a more refined version of the Levins classification, called Intersective Levin classes (ILCs) (Dang et al. , 1998).

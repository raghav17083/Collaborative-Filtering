This claim is supported by Tanaka and Baldwin (2003a), who found that static bilingual dictionaries had a type coverage of around 84% and 94% over the top250 most frequent English and Japanese NN compounds, respectively, but only 27% and 60%, respectively, over a random sample of NN compounds occurring more than 10 times in the corpus. 
In evaluation, Tanaka and Baldwin (2003b) found the principal failing of this method to be its treatment of all translations contained in the transfer dictionary as being equally likely, where in fact 3In the original formulation, the product a58a60a59a62a61 a9a32a11 a13a64a63 a58a60a59a62a61 a9a32a11 a11 a63 a58a60a59a4a65 a63 was included as a third term, but Tanaka and Baldwin (2003b) found it to have negligible impact on translation accuracy, so we omit it here. 
It is based on the assumption that NN compounds translate compositionality between Japanese and English, which Tanaka and Baldwin (2003a) found to be the case 43.1% of the time for JapaneseEnglish (JE) MT and 48.7% of the time for EnglishJapanese (EJ) MT. In this paper, we focus primarily on selecting the correct translation for those NN compounds which can be translated compositionally, but we also investigate what happens when non-compositional NN compounds are translated using a compositional method. 
The overall proportion of translation-compositional inputs is somewhat lower than suggested by Tanaka and Baldwin (2003a), although this is conditional on the coverage of the particular dictionaries we use. 
Tanaka and Baldwin (2003) found that 48.7% of English-Japanese Noun-Noun compounds translate compositionality.

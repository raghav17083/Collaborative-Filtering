Relevance between term candidates and documents is the most popular feature used for term verification such as TF-IDF (Salton and McGill, 1983; Frank, 1999) and Inter-Domain Entropy (Chang, 2005), which are all based on the hypothesis that if a candidate occurs frequently in a few documents of a domain, it is likely a term.

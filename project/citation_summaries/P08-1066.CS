They can be roughly divided into three categories: string-to-tree models (e.g., (Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008)), tree-to-string models (e.g., (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006)), and tree-totree models (e.g., (Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008)). 
Due to the lack of a good Arabic parser compatible with the Sakhr tokenization that we used on the source side, we did not test the source dependency LM for Arabic-to-English MT. When extracting rules with source dependency structures, we applied the same well-formedness constraint on the source side as we did on the target side, using a procedure described by (Shen et al., 2008). 
This provides a compelling advantage over previous dependency language models for MT (Shen et al., 2008),whichusea5-gramLMonlyduringreranking. 
There is also substantial work in the use of target-side syntax (Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008). 
1 Introduction Hierarchical approaches to machine translation have proven increasingly successful in recent years (Chiang, 2005; Marcu et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008), and often outperform phrase-based systems (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003) on target-language fluency and adequacy.

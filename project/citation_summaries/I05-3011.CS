We formulate the block extraction as a local search problem following the work in Zhao and Waibel (2005): given a source letter n-gram fj+lj, search for the projected boundaries of candidate target letter n-gram ei+ki according to a weighted combination of the diverse features in a log-linear model detailed in4.3.

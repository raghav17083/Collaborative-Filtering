Some earlier systems related to our work are FaqFinder (Kulyukin et al. , 1998), MURAX (Kupiec, 1993), which uses an encyclopedia as a knowledge base from which to extract answers, and PROFILE (Radev and McKeown, 1997) which identifies named entities and noun phrases that describe them in text. 
Biography generation is an exciting field that has attracted practitioners of NLG in the past (Kim et al. , 2002; Schiffman et al. , 2001; Radev and McKeown, 1997; Teich and Bateman, 1994). 
Single-snippet definitions can also be useful in information extraction, where the templates to be filled in often require short entity descriptions; see Radev and McKeown (1997). 
Finally, while most classical approaches, exemplified by (McKeown, 1985; Moore and Paris, 1992) tend to perform the Content Selection task integrated with the document planning, recently, the interest in automatic, bottom-up content planners has put forth a simplified view where the information is entirely selected before the document structuring process begins (Marcu, 1997; Karamanis and Manurung, 2002). 
We present a system, called SUMMONS 1 (McKeown and Radev 1995; Radev 1996; Radev and McKeown 1997), shown in Figure 1, which introduces novel techniques in the following areas:  It briefs the user on information of interest using tools related to information extraction, conceptual combination, and text generation.

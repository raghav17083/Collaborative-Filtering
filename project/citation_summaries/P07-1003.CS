DeNero and Klein (2007) use a syntaxbased distance in an HMM word alignment model to favor syntax-friendly alignments. 
For example, the HMM aligner achieves an AER of 20.7 when using the competitive thresholding heuristic of DeNero and Klein (2007). 
Approaches have been proposed recently towards getting better word alignment and thus better TTS templates, such as encoding syntactic structure information into the HMM-based word alignment model DeNero and Klein (2007), and build62 ing a syntax-based word alignment model May and Knight (2007) with TTS templates. 
We also trained an HMM aligner as described in DeNero and Klein (2007) and used the posteriors of this model as features. 
For example, the word alignment computed by GIZA++ and used as a basis to extract the TTS templates in most SSMT systems has been observed to be a problem for SSMT (DeNero and Klein, 2007; May and Knight, 2007), due to the fact that the word-based alignment models are not aware of the syntactic structure of the sentences and could produce many syntax-violating word alignments.

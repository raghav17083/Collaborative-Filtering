Although there exist several manually-created verb lexicons or ontologies, including Levins verb taxonomy, VerbNet, and FrameNet, automatic verb classification (AVC) is still necessary for extending existing lexicons (Korhonen and Briscoe, 2004), building and tuning lexical information specific to different domains (Korhonen et al., 2006), and bootstrapping verb lexicons for new languages (Tsang et al., 2002). 
Some have supplemented them with further information about verb tense, voice, and/or semantic selectional preferences on argument heads.2 The preliminary experiment on biomedical verb classification (Korhonen et al., 2006) employed basic syntactic features only: SCFs extracted from corpus data using the system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997) which operates on the output of a domain-independent robust statistical parser (RASP) (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002). 
SCFs were extracted from the publicly available VALEX lexicon (Korhonen et al., 2006a). 
The preliminary experiment on biomedical verb classification (Korhonen et al., 2006) experimented only with them. 
Although some fixed classifications are available (e.g. VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005)) these are not comprehensive and are inadequate for specific domains (Korhonen et al., 2006b).

uncertainty constraints, used in the LFG treatment of long-distance dependencies (Kaplan and Zaenen 1989) appear to have a decidable satisfiability problem (Kaplan and Maxwell 1988a), but the satisfiability problem for arbitrary boolean combinations of functional uncertainty constraints is undecidable (Keller 1991), so these cannot be expressed using SB formulae either (since the quantifier-free subclass of SB is closed under boolean operations). 
1 For examples of this approach see Dawar and Vijay-Shanker (1990), D6rre and Eisele (1990), Johnson (1988, 1990a, 1990b, 1991a, 1991b, in press a), Karttunen (1984), Kasper (1987a, 1987b, 1988), Kasper and Rounds (1986, 1990), Langholm (1989), Pereira (1987), and Smolka (1992). 
tVIodeling syntactic constraints on anaphoric binding Mary Dalrymple SRI International and Stanford University John Maxwell Xerox-PARC Annie Zaenen Xerox-PARC and CSLI, Stanford University Abstract Syntactic constraints on antecedent-anaphor relations can be stated within the theory of Lexical Functional Grammar (henceforth LFG) through the use of functional uncertainty (Kaplan and Maxwell 1988; Halvorsen and Kaplan 1988; Ksplan and Zaenen 1989). 
This is indicated in the second condition by the regular expression TOPIC OF*; this expression involves functional uncertainty (Kaplan and Maxwell, 1988) and requires that the relative pronoun relp must appear at the end of a path that is a member of the language described by the regular exprestmn. 
2 This is because the recognition problem for an arbitrary "unification-based" grammar is undecidable unless the size of the phrase structure tree is constrained somehow, e.g., by the offiine parsability constraint (Johnson 1988; Kaplan and Bresnan 1982; Pereira 1982; Shieber 1992), but there seems to be no natural way to impose such constraints in these systems because the encoding of the phrase structure tree in the feature structure is not distinguished from other features.

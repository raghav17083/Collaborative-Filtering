Based on these grammars, a great number of SMT models have been recently proposed, including string-to-string model (Synchronous FSG) (Brown et al., 1993; Koehn et al., 2003), tree-to-string model (TSG-string) (Huang et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007), string-totree model (string-CFG/TSG) (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006), tree-to-tree model (Synchronous CFG/TSG, Data-Oriented Translation) (Chiang, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Zhang et al., 2007; Bod, 2007; Quirk wt al., 2005; Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003) and so on. 
(2006)) and closely related formalisms like synchronous tree substitution grammars (Eisner, 2003). 
In computational linguistics, the bottom-up version of this algorithm resembles the tree parsing algorithm for TSG by Eisner (2003). 
See e.g., Eisner (2003) for a more formal de nition. 
They can be roughly divided into three categories: string-to-tree models (e.g., (Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008)), tree-to-string models (e.g., (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006)), and tree-totree models (e.g., (Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008)).

 hierarchical: annotation of features at multiple levels, building upon lower levels of analysis at the clause or sentence level (Moser and Moore, 1995; Marcu, et al. 1999)  document-level: broad characterization of document structure such as identification of topical segments (Hearst, 1997), linking of large text segments via specific relations (Ferrari, 1998; Rebeyrolle, 2000), or defining text objects with a text architecture (Pery-Woodley and Rebeyrolle, 1998). 
 Previous research on annotating texts with rhetorical structure trees (Marcu et al. , 1999) has shown that texts can be annotated by multiple judges at relatively high levels of agreement. 
Details of the annotation process are given in (Marcu et al. , 1999). 
So far, the annotation of discourse structure of documents has been applied primarily to identifying topical segments (Hearst, 1997), inter-sentential relations (Nomoto and Matsumoto, 1999; Tsou et al. , 2000), and hierarchical analyses of small corpora (Moser and Moore, 1995; Marcu et al. , 1999). 
(Marcu, et al. , 1999) show that over a corpus of texts drawn from MUC newspaper texts, the Wall Street Journal corpus, and the Brown Corpus, reliable agreement among annotators is consistently obtained for discourse segmentation and assignment of nuclear-satellite status, while agreement on rhetorical labeling was less reliable (statistically significant for only the MUC texts).

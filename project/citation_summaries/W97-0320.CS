Introduction Although machine learning approaches have achieved success in many areas of Natural Language Processing, researchers have only recently begun to investigate applying machine learning methods to discourse-level problems (Reithinger and Klesen, 1997; Di Eugenio et al., 1997; Wiebe et al., 1997; Andernach, 1996; Litman, 1994). 
4.1 Selecting Collocations Following are two methods for selecting collocation words of a given collocational property (Wiebe et al. 1997a). 
Furthermore, using metalearning to combine multiple learning methods hierachically (sometimes called stacked generalization; Chan and Stolfo \[1993\], and Wolpert \[1992\]), according to the JAM (Java Agents for Metalearning) model (Stolfo et al. 1997), produced equivalent results. 
Following are two organizations for each selection method (Wiebe et al. 1997a). 
The experiments performed here use collocational properties defined in Wiebe et al. 1997a to perform the event categorization task described in section 2.

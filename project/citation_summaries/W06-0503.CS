Studying relationships between tagged named entities, (Hasegawa et al, 2004; Hassan et al, 2006) proposed unsupervised clustering methods that assign given (or semi-automatically extracted) sets of pairs into several clusters, where each cluster corresponds to one of a known relationship type. 
2.1 Relationship Types There is a large body of related work that deals with discovery of basic relationship types represented in useful resources such as WordNet, including hypernymy (Hearst, 1992; Pantel et al., 2004; Snow et al., 2006), synonymy (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006; Widdows and Dorow, 2002) and meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Girju et al., 2006). 
(Alfonseca et al., 2006) for extracting general relations starting from given seed word pairs. 
Studying relationships between tagged named entities, (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Hassan et al., 2006) proposed unsupervised clustering methods that assign given sets of pairs into several clusters, where each cluster corresponds to one of a known set of relationship types. 
These lists included patterns expressing hypernymy (Hearst, 1992; Pantel et al., 2004), meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Girju et al., 2006), synonymy (Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006), and verb strength + verb happensbefore (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).

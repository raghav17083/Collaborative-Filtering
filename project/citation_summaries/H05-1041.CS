Previously reported experiments (Androutsopoulos and Galanis, 2005) showed that ATTW leads to significantly better results, compared to training the classifier on all the available TREC windows, for which regular expressions are available, and then using it to classify Web windows. 
To this effect, the use of hand-written lexico-syntactic patterns and regular expressions, targeting the genus and possibly the differentia of the question concept, is widespread, whether employed for mining de nitions in English (Liu et al., 2003; Hildebrandt et al., 2004) or other languages such as Japanese (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2004), from local text collections (Xu et al., 2004) or from the Web (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2004; Androutsopoulos and Galanis, 2005). 
The use of machine learning techniques can be found in Miliaraki and Androutsopoulos (2004) and Androutsopoulos and Galanis (2005) They use similar patterns as (Joho and Sanderson, 2000) to construct training attributes. 
In subsequent work (Androutsopoulos and Galanis, 2005), we developed ATTW (automatic taggingoftrainingwindows),atechniquethatproduces arbitrarily large collections of training windows from the Web with practically no manual effort, in effect making our overall system unsupervised. 
Features for lexical patterns, as used in (Androutsopoulos and Galanis, 2005), e.g. qn which (is|was|are|were) dp, are not added because in this experiment we investigate only a copular pattern.

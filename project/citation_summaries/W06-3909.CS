We instantiate such relations instead of the classical is-a patterns since these have been shown to bring in too many false positives, see (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) for a discussion of such generic patterns. 
A third approach has been to use a very small number of seed instances or patterns to do bootstrap learning (Brin, 1998; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Etzioni et al., 2005; Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2006; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Rozenfeld and Feldman, 2008). 
For example, many classic relation extraction systems (Hearst, 1992; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006; Pasca et al., 2006) are based on a single pattern-based extractor KE, which is seeded with a set of patterns or instances for a given relation (e.g. the pattern X starred in Y for the act-in relation). 
Typically algorithms are compared using one set of hand-picked seeds for each category (Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2006; McIntosh and Curran, 2008). 
such as Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) and Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2006) use the same formalism of learning regular expressions over words and part-of-speech tags to discover patterns indicating a variety of relations.

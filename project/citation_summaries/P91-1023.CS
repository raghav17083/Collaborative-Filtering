3 Bilingual Task: An Application for Word Alignment 3.1 Sentence and word alignment Bilingual alignment methods (Warwick et al. , 1990; Brown et al. , 1991a; Brown et al. , 1993; Gale and Church, 1991b; Gale and Church, 1991a; Kay and Roscheisen, 1993; Simard et al. , 1992; Church, 1993; Kupiec, 1993a; Matsumoto et al. , 1993; Dagan et al. , 1993). 
Parallel bilingual corpora have been shown to provide a rich source of constraints for statistical analysis (Brown et al. 1990; Gale and Church 1991; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Church 1993; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Department of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong. 
Related Work The recent availability of large amounts of bilingual data has attracted interest in several areas, including sentence alignment (Gale and Church 1991b; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Simard, Foster and Isabelle 1992; Gale and Church 1993; Chen 1993), word alignment (Gale and Church 1991a; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994; Fung 1995b), alignment of groups of words (Smadja 1992; Kupiec 1993; van der Eijk 1993), and statistical translation (Brown et al. 1993). 
All sentences are aligned using a tool based on the Gale and Church (1991) algorithm. 
4 Conclusions Compared with other word alignment algorithms (Brown et al. , 1993; Gale and Church, 1991a), word_align does not require sentence alignment as input, and was shown to produce useful alignments for small and noisy corpora.

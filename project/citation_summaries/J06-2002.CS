2 Spatial Relations in Referring Expression Generation The bulk of the existing literature on referring expression generation (see, for example, Dale (1989), Dale and Reiter (1995), van Deemter (2006), Horacek (2004), Gatt and van Deemter (2006)) generally focuses on the use of non-relational properties, which can either be absolute (for example, colour) or relative (for example, size). 
I dealt with cases of this type in my paper on vague descriptions (van Deemter 2006), where a generator takes numerical height measurements to produce noun phrases that involve gradable adjectives: the tall guy, the fastest one of the three heavy tortoises. 
1 Introduction In recent years, researchers working on referring expression generation have increasingly moved towards collecting their own data on the human production of referring expressions (REs) (Krahmer and Theune, 2002; van der Sluis and Krahmer, 2004; Gatt and van Deemter, 2006; Belz and Varges, 2007); and the recent Attribute Selection in the Generation of Referring Expressions (ASGRE) Challenge used the TUNA corpus (Gatt et al., 2007), which is the most extensive collection of referring expressions to date. 
155 cussion among linguists, philosophers, and theoretical economists (Lipman 2000, 2006; De Jaegher 2003; Van Rooij 2003), focussing on the question under what circumstances vagueness can lead to a higher utility than crispness. 
Kelleher and Kruijff (2005, 2006) cite Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986) Principle of Minimal Cooperative Effort and Dale and Reiters (1995) Principle of Sensitivity, as well as van der Sluis and Krahmers (2004) production study, to motivate the ordering over the types of properties that can be used by their system; accordingly, their system only includes spatial (and hence relational) information in a referring expression if it is not possible to construct a description from non-relational properties.

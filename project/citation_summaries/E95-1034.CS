Hoffman, in her thesis (Hoffman, 1995a, Hoffman, 1995b), has used the MultisetCombinatory Categorial Grammar formalism (Hoffman, 1992), an extension of Combinatory Categorial Grammar to handle free word order languages, to develop a generator for Turkish. 
Again, while the former is catered for in most tactical generation systems, only selected aspects of the latter have been dealt with and only for selected languages (e.g. , (Hoffman, 1994; Hoffman, 1995; Hakkani et al. , 1996)). 
The grammar used for the generation of 3hlrkish is a lexicalist formalism called Multiset-CCG (Hoffman, 1995; Iloffman, 1995b), an extension of CCGs. 
Furthermore, the ability for dimensions to interact through shared indices brings several advantages: (1) parallel derivations (Hoffman, 1995) are unnecessary; (2) non-isomorphic, functional structures across different dimensions can be employed; and (3) there is no longer a need to load all the necessary information into syntactic categories (as with Kruijff (2001)). 
The literature presents various proposals for how information structure can be captured in categorial grammar (Steedman, 2000a; Hoffman, 1995; Kruijff, 2001).

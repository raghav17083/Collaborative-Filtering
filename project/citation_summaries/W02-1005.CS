4.3 The MMVC Model The Mixture Maximum Variance Correction classifier (MMVC henceforth) (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 2002) is a two step classifier. 
We used the same test set (2056 tokens from the Brown corpus) and confusion sets as Golding and Schabes (1996), Mangu and Brill (1997), and Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2002). 
These include a variety of Bayesian classifiers (Golding, 1995; Golding and Schabes, 1996), decision lists (Golding, 1995) transformation-based learning (Mangu and Brill, 1997), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Jones and Martin, 1997), multiplicative weight update algorithms (Golding and Roth, 1999), and augmented mixture models (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 2002).

A variety of classifiers have been employed for this task (see Mooney [1996] and Ide and Veronis [1998] for overviews), the most popular being decision lists (Yarowsky 1994, 1995) and naive Bayesian classifiers (Pedersen 2000; Ng 1997; Pedersen and Bruce 1998; Mooney 1996; Cucerzan and Yarowsky 2002).

As the grammar grew larger, the process of consistent grammar development and maintenance became harder (Vijay-Shanker and Schabes, 1992). 
The approach based on tree descriptions (often called, the metagrammar approach) obviates the procedural character of the non-monotonic approach by taking tree descriptions rather than trees to be the basic units (Candito, 1996; Xia et al. , 1999; Vijay-Shanker and Schabes, 1992). 
Hierarchical representations of LTAG have been proposed: (VijayShanker and Schabes, 1992), (Becker, 1993), (Evans et al. , 1995), (Candito, 1996), (Doran et al. , 1997). 
To complete the description of the rest of the elementary quasi-trees one would have to use transformations, meta-rules, or lexical rules to specify the structures for passivization, wh-movement, topicalization, etc. Work along this direction is being carried out (Vijay-Shanker and Schabes 1992). 
The issue of efficient representation for I_'rAG 1 is discussed by Vijay-Shanker & Schabes (1992), who 1As with all fully lexicMized grammar formalisms, there is really no conceptual distinction to be drawn in I_TAG between the lexicon and the grammar: tile gramrnatical rules are just lexical properties.

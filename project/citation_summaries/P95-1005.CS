First, most plan-based or finite state automaton based discourse processors (Allen and Schubert, 1991; Smith, Hipp, and Biermann, 1995; Lambert, 1993; Reithinger and Maim:, 1995), including tile one we initially developed (l~.osd et al. , 1995), only take one semantic representation as input at a time: thus, we had to extend the discourse processor so thai; it can handle multiple hypotheses as input. 
Using Discourse Predictions for Ambiguity Resolution Yan Qu, Carolyn P. Ros6 and Barbara Di Eugenio Computational Linguistics Program Department of Philosophy Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213 {yqu,cprose} (6) cs.cmu.edu,dieugeni~cmu.cdu Abstract In this paper we discuss how we allply discourse predictions along with non context-based predictions to the problem of parse disambiguation in Enthusiast, a Spanish-to-English translation system (Woszcyna et al. , 1993; Snhm et al. , 1994; Levin el; al. , 1995). 
Centering's Rule 1 states that if any element of the previous utterance's forward looking center list is realized in the current utterance as a pronoun, then the backward looking center must be realized as a pronoun as well (Grosz et al. , 1995. 
Another promising area is speech act (dialogue move) tagging, where, for example, researchers have tested whether an automatic tagger trained on the tagged corpus can improve the performance of a speech recognizer with tag-specific language models (Taylor et al. 1996), and whether an induced discourse model based on the tagging can predict the next dialogue act in the dialogue, and thus affect how the system translates the next utterance (Reithinger and Maier 1995; Nagata 1992). 
A plan-based discourse processor (Ros6 et al., 1995) provides contextual expectations that guide the system in the manner in which it formulates 1132 Sentence: What about any time but the ten to twelve slot on Tuesday the thirtieth?

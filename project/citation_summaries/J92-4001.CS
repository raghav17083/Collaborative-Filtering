I Introduction The application of decision-based learning techniques over rich sets of linguistic features has improved significantly the coverage and performance of syntactic (and to various degrees semantic) parsers (Simmons and Yu, 1992; Magerman, 1995; Hermjakob and Mooney, 1997). 
Simmons & Yu (1992) introduced the context-dependent grammar for English parsing, in which the context-dependent rules can be acquired through an interactive mechanism, the phrase structure analysis and case analysis were conducted through a stack based shift/shift parser, with success ratio reached as high as 99%. 
This contrasts with approaches where there are essentially no explicit rules, such as neural networks (e.g. \[Buo 1996\]), or approaches where the machine learning algorithms attempt to infer--via deduction (e.g. \[Samuelsson 1994\]), induction (e.g. \[Theeramunkong et al. 1997\]; \[Zelle & Mooney 1994\]) under user cooperation (e.g. \[Simmons & Yu 1992\]; \[Hermjakob & Mooney 1997\]), transformation-based error-driven learning (e.g. \[Brill 1993\]), or even decision trees (e.g. \[Magerman 1995\])--a grammar from raw or preprocessed data. 
(2) The convergence of the CDG rule According to the analysis of (Simmons & Yu 1992), 25,000 CDG rules will be sufficient to cover the 99% phenomenon of English common sentences. 
In matching process, weighted matching approach (Simmons & Yu, 1992) is used.

Currently, the best-performing English NP interpretation methods in computational linguistics focus mostly on two consecutive noun instances (noun compounds) and are either (weakly) supervised, knowledge-intensive (Rosario and Hearst, 2001), (Rosario et al. , 2002), (Moldovan et al. , 2004), (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006), (Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2006), (Kim and Baldwin, 2006), (Snow et al. , 2006), (Girju et al. , 2005; Girju et al. , 2006), or use statistical models on large collections of unlabeled data (Berland and Charniak, 1999), (Lapata and Keller, 2004), (Nakov and Hearst, 2005), (Turney, 2006).


Other researchers (Pantel and Ravichandran 2004; Pantel and Pennacchiotti 2006; Pennacchiotti and Pantel 2006) use clustering techniques coupled with syntactic dependency features to identify IS-A relations in large text collections.Kim and Baldwin (2005) propose a general-purpose method that computes the lexical similarity of unseen nounnoun compounds with those found in training.More recently Kim and Baldwin (2006) developed an automatic method for interpreting nounnoun compounds based on a set of 20 semantic relations.The relations are detected based on a xed set of constructions involving the constituent nouns and a set of seed verbs denoting the semantic relation (e.g., to own denotes POSSESSION).Then all nounnoun instances 4 These results were obtained on AltaVista on a general and abstract set of eight prepositions (Lauer 1995) as semantic classication categories: of,for,with,in,on,at,about,andfrom.


Finally, methods in the literature more focused on a specific disambiguation task include statistical methods for the attachment of hyponyms under the most likely hypernym in the WordNet taxonomy (Snow et al., 2006), structural approaches based on semantic clusters and distance metrics (Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2006), supervised machine learning methods for the disambiguation of meronymy relations (Girju et al., 2003), etc. 6 Conclusions In this paper we presented a novel approach to disambiguate the glosses of computational lexicons and machine-readable dictionaries, with the aim of alleviating the knowledge acquisition bottleneck.

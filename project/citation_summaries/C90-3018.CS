Also, in our state machine, we havent accounted for the impact of connectives such as but or although; we propose drawing on work in argumentative orientation to do so ((Anscombre and Ducrot, 1983); (Elhadad and McKeown, 1990)). 
(Elhadad and McKeown, 1990) explored the problem of cue selection. 
Previous research (Hobbs, 1985; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Schiffrin, 1987; Mann and Thompson, 1988; Elhadad and McKeown, 1990), which has been largely descriptive, suggests factors such as structural features of the discourse (e.g. , level of embedding and segment complexity), intentional and informational relations in that structure, ordering of relata, and syntactic form of discourse constituents. 
In linguistic constructs such as conjunctions, which impose constraints on the semantic orientation of their arguments (Anscombre and Ducrot, 1983; Elhadad and McKeown, 1990), the choices of arguments and connective are mutually constrained, as illustrated by: The tax proposal was simple and well-received } simplistic but well-received *simplistic and well-received by the public. 
80 2 Related Work McKeown and Elhadad (1991; 1990) studied severai connectives (e.g. , but, since, because), and include many insightful hypotheses about cue selection; their observation that the distinction between but and lthoug/~ depends on the point of the move is related to the notion of core discussed below.

The work reported in the present paper is related to work reported by Calzolari (1984a, 1984b) and Calzolari and Picchi(1986). 
Machine-readable dictionaries Jbr WSD There have been several attempts to exploit the information in maclfine-readable versions of everyday dictionaries (see, tor instance, Amsler, 1980; Calzolari, 1984; Chodorow, Byrd and Heidorn, 1985; Markowitz, Ahlswede and Evens, 1986; Byrd et al. , 1987; V&onis, Ide and Wurbel, 1989), in which an enormous amount of lexical and semantic knowledge is already "encoded". 
In this paper, we will focus on analyzing the definitions not for the genus terms, but for the semantic relations that can be extracted from the differentiae (Calzolari 1984). 
Head finding, also described in Chodorow, et a1.(1985) and in Calzolari(1984a), is a method for automatically discovering the hypernym (or genus term) for a word by analyzing its dictionary definition. 
Work reported in Alshawi(1985), Calzolari (1983,1984a,b), Lesk(1986), Michiels(1982), etc. , describe various attempts to decipher and extract information in machine-readable versions of published dictionaries (henceforth: MRDs).

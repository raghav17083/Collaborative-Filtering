The constraint gives also the expected behavior for comparatives such as: John is taller than him (Bill) John is as tall as him (John)* because it applies to the arguments of a predicate more used in the LF representation of comparative constructions (Alshawi and van Eijck 1989), the final LF for the first of the examples above being \[more, E" F" \[tall--degree,E,FLjohn,bill\]. 
Alshawi, Hiyan and Jan van Eijck (1989) "Logical Forms in the Core Language Engine". 
2 DERIVING LFs FROM QLFs 2.1 QLF CONSTRUCTS The QLF language is a superset of the LF (logical form) language used in the CLE (Alshawi and van Eijck 1989). 
These are the 'quasi logical forms' (QLF) of Alshawi and van Eijck (1989), differing from 'resolved logical forms' (RLF) in several respects: they contain 'a_terms' representing the memlings of pronouns and other contextually dependent NPs; 'a.fornm' (anaphoric formula) representing the meanings of sentences containing contextually determined predicates (possessives, compound nominals, 'have' 'do' etc); and 'q_terms' representing the meaning of other quantified NPs before the later explicit quantifier scoping phase (see Moran 1988). 
We use semantic structures derived from those in the King Kong NL interface (Bayer d Vilain 1991) ; these are in turn related to the "interpretation level" of Alshawi erVan Eijck (1989).

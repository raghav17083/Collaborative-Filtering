2 Multivariate Syllable Clustering EM-based clustering has been derived and applied to syntax (Rooth et al. , 1999). 
Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth (2000) evaluated Rooth et al.s (1999) EM-based clustering model again using pseudodisambiguation, but on a separate data set using a Table 13 Percentage of correct disambiguations on the pseudodisambiguation task using Web counts and counts re-created using EM-based clustering (Rooth et al. 1999). 
4 Related Work Our model is an extension of and thus most closely related to the latent semantic clustering (LSC) model (Rooth et al., 1999) for verb-argument pairs v,a which defines their probability as follows: p(v,a) =summationdisplay c p(c) p(v|c) p(a|c) In comparison to our model, the LSC model only considers a single argument (such as direct objects), 6For readability, we only list one noun per WordNet concept. 
Threeand five-dimensional EM-based clustering has been applied to monolingual phonological data (Muller et al. , 2000) and two-dimensional clustering to syntax (Rooth et al. , 1999). 
The probabilities were re-created using Rooth et al.s (1999) EM-based clustering model on a training set from which all seen pairs (v, n) had been removed.

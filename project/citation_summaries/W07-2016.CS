To date, the best approaches that solve the all words WSD task are supervised as illustrated in the different SenseEval and SEMEVAL All Words tasks (M. Palmer and Dang, 2001; Snyder and Palmer, 2004; Pradhan et al., 2007). 
For the second approach, we just need to map PropBank roles into VerbNet roles using SemLink (Loper et al., 2007). 
(Suchanek et al., 2007)), is 0.59. 
The methods used in this paper originated in (Agirre et al., 2005; Agirre and Lopez de Lacalle, 2007), where SVD over a feature-to-documents matrix improved WSD performance with and without unlabeled data. 
An important consideration within this general SRL architecture is the combination of systems and input annotations.Most SRL systems include some kind of combination to increase robustness, gain coverage, and reduce effects of parse errors.One may combine: (1) the output of several independent SRL basic systems (Surdeanu et al.2007; Pradhan et al.2005b), or (2) several outputs from the same SRL system obtained by changing input annotations or other internal parameters (Koomen et al. 2005; Toutanova, Haghighi, and Manning 2005).The combination can be as simple as selecting the best among the set of complete candidate solutions, but usually consists of combining fragments of alternative solutions to construct the nal output.Finally, the combination component may involve machine learning or not.The gain in performance from the combination step is consistently between two and three F 1 points.However, a combination approach increases system complexity and penalizes efciency.

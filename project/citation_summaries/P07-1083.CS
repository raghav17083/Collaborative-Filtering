Decision Model 4 Ranking the transliteration candidates is done by evaluating: s = argmaxi WD IFW(si)), which conceptually resembles the transliteration model presented in (Bergsma and Kondrak, 2007), in that a discriminative classifier was trained and used over a pruned feature set. 
Another SVM classifier incorporates the five string metrics; this system can be considered as our reproduction of the discriminative string similarity proposed by Bergsma and Kondrak (2007). 
While linguists define cognates as words derived from a common root3 (Bickford and Tuggy, 2002), computational linguists typically ignore origin, defining them as words in different languages that are mutual translations and have a similar orthography (Bergsma and Kondrak, 2007; Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Melamed, 1999). 
Training the transliteration model is typically done under supervised settings (Bergsma and Kondrak, 2007; Goldwasser and Roth, 2008b), or weakly supervised settings with additional temporal information (Sproat et al., 2006; Klementiev and Roth, 2006a). 
Several papers have followed up on this basic approach and focused on semi-supervised approaches to this problem or on extracting better features for the discriminative classifier (Klementiev and Roth, 2006b; Bergsma and Kondrak, 2007; Goldwasser and Roth, 2008).

The experiment was carried out using both the chunking criteria from (Rayner and Samuelsson, 1994) (the "Old" scheme), and the chunking criteria described in Section 3 above (the "New" scheme). 
In (Rayner and Samuelsson, 1994), a simple scheme is given, which creates rules corresponding to four possible units: full utterances, recursive NPs, PPs, and non-recursive NPs. 
This part of the paper is essentially an extension and generalization of the line of work described in (Rayner, 1988; Rayner and Samuelsson, 1990; Samuelsson and Rayner, 1991; Rayner and Samuelsson, 1994; Samuelsson, 1994b). 
A more elaborate scheme is given in (Samuelsson, 1994b), where the "chunking criteria" are learned automatically by an entropy-minimization method; the results, however, do not appear to improve on the earlier ones. 
Our current scheme is an extension of the one from (Rayner and Samuelsson, 1994), where the rulechunks are trees of non-phrasal rules whose roots and leaves are categories of the following possible types: full utterances, utterance units, imperative VPs, NPs, relative clauses, VP modifiers and PPs.

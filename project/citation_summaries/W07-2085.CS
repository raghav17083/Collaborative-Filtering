To improve results, some systems utilize additional manually constructed semantic resources such as WordNet (WN) (Beamer et al., 2007).


Among the 15 systems presented by the 14 SemEval teams, some utilized the manually provided WordNet tags for the dataset pairs (e.g., (Beamer et al., 2007)).


For reference, the best results overall (Beamer et al., 2007) are also shown.

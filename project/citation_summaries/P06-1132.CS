2.1 Task of case marker prediction Our definition of the case marker prediction task follows Suzuki and Toutanova (2006). 
3 Related Work Models for determiner and preposition selection have mostly been investigated in the context of sentence realization and machine translation (Knight and Chander 1994, Gamon et al. 2002, Bond 2005, Suzuki and Toutanova 2006, Toutanova and Suzuki 2007). 
The framework suggested here is most closely related to (Suzuki and Toutanova, 2006), which uses a probabilistic model to generate Japanese case markers for English-to-Japanese MT. This work can be viewed as a generalization of (Suzuki and Toutanova, 2006) in that our model generates inflected forms of words, and is not limited to generating a small, closed set of case markers. 
Aligned English-Japanese sentence pair 51 3.2 Model features and feature selection The features of our model are similar to the ones described in Suzuki and Toutanova (2006). 
This independence assumption may seem strong, but the results presented in our previous work (Suzuki and Toutanova, 2006) showed that a joint model did not result in large improvements over a local one in predicting case markers in a nonMT context.

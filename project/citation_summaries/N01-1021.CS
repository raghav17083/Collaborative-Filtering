Probabilistic parsing techniques also have been used for sentence processing modeling (Jurafsky, 1996; Narayanan and Jurafsky, 2002; Hale, 2001; Crocker and Brants, 2000). 
Hale (2001) suggests this quantity as an index of psycholinguistic difficulty. 
This conclusion is strengthened when we turn to consider the performance of the parser on the standard Penn Treebank test set: the Within model showed a small increase in F-score over the PCFG baseline, while the copy model showed no such advantage.5 All the models we proposed offer a broadcoverage account of human parsing, not just a limited model on a hand-selected set of examples, such as the models proposed by Jurafsky (1996) and Hale (2001) (but see Crocker and Brants 2000). 
Since Marcus work, a significant body of work on incremental parsing has developed in the sentence processing community, but much of this work has actually suggested models with an increased amount of nondeterminism, often with probabilistic weights (e.g. , Narayanan & Jurafsky (1998); Hale (2001)). 
For example, scores derived from variously estimated language models have been used to evaluate and classify language samples associated with neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders (Roark et al., 2007; Solorio and Liu, 2008; Gabani et al., 2009), as well as within general studies of human sentence processing (Hale, 2001; 2003; 2006).

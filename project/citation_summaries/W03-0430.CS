A wide variety of machine learning methods have been applied to this problem, including Hidden Markov Models (Bikel et al. 1997), Maximum Entropy methods (Borthwick et al. 1998, Chieu and Ng 2002), Decision Trees (Sekine et al. 1998), Conditional Random Fields (McCallum and Li 2003), Class-based Language Model (Sun et al. 2002), Agent-based Approach (Ye et al. 2002) and Support Vector Machines. 
CRFs have been previously applied to other tasks such as name entity extraction (McCallum and Li, 2003), table extraction (Pinto et al. , 2003) and shallow parsing (Sha and Pereira, 2003). 
Another combination of five systems (Carreras et al. , 2003b; Mayfield et al. , 2003; McCallum and Li, 2003; Munro et al. , 2003; Zhang and Johnson, 2003) obtained the best result for the German development data. 
On the other hand, in text-based NER, better results are obtained using discriminative schemes such as maximum entropy (ME) models (Borthwick, 1999; Chieu and Ng, 2003), support vector machines (SVMs) (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002), and conditional random fields (CRFs) (McCallum and Li, 2003). 
CRFs have been shown to perform well on a number of NLP problems such as shallow parsing (Sha and Pereira, 2003), table extraction (Pinto et al. , 2003), and named entity recognition (McCallum and Li, 2003).

In this section, we propose a discriminative word lexicon model that follows (Bangalore et al., 2007) and integrate it into the standard phrasebased machine translation approach. 
The model for Global Lexical Selection and Sentence Re-construction (Bangalore et al., 2007) is one such approach. 
In comparison with the translation model from (Bangalore et al., 2007) where a threshold on the probability is used to determine which words are included in the target sentence, our approach relies on the phrase model to generate translation candidates. 
However, we plan to test our models with these applications, especially on the two-stage statistical MT approach using the bag-of-words obtained by Global Lexical Selection (Bangalore et al., 2007),(Venkatapathy and Bangalore, 2007). 
Measures of cross-language relatedness are useful for a large number of applications, including cross-language information retrieval (Nie et al., 1999; Monz and Dorr, 2005), cross-language text classification (Gliozzo and Strapparava, 2006), lexical choice in machine translation (Och and Ney, 2000; Bangalore et al., 2007), induction of translation lexicons (Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002), cross-language annotation and resource projections to a second language (Riloff et al., 2002; Hwa et al., 2002; Mohammad et al., 2007).

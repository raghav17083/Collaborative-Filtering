However, the actual scientific content has remained largely unenhanced, this falling to secondary services and experimental websites such as GoPubMed (Delfs et al. , 2005) or EBIMed (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al. , 2007). 
2 Corpus Previously, we have produced a set of annotation guidelines for chemical named entities, and used them to annotate a set of 42 chemistry papers (Corbett et al., 2007). 
Considerable progress has been made in the development of basic resources (e.g. ontologies, annotated corpora) and techniques (e.g. Information Retrieval (IR), Information Extraction (IE)) in this area, and research has began to focus on increasingly challenging tasks, e.g. summarization and the discovery of novel information in biomedical literature (Hunter and Cohen 2006, Ananiadou et al. 2006, Zweigenbaum et al. 2007). 
The OSCAR3 (Corbett et al., 2007) tool for the recognition and annotation of chemical named entities fully displays underlying paper information in XML but is not suited to sentence by sentence annotation. 
In recent past, there has been an increasing demand for research which is driven by actual user needs rather than technical developments (Zweigenbaum et al. 2007).

(1998) supported this finding: the study found that the strategy found to be optimal for anaphoric definite descriptions by Vieira and Poesio (2000), considering as equally likely all antecedents in the previous five-sentence window (as opposed to preferring closer antecedents), gave poor results for bridging references; entities introduced in the last two sentences and main entities were clearly preferred. 
First, whereas pronouns are mostly anaphoric in written text, definite NPs do not have to be so, inducing the problem of whether a definite NP is anaphoric in addition to determining an antecedent from among a set of potential antecedents (Fraurud 1990; Vieira and Poesio 2000). 
Vieira and Poesio (2000) proposed an algorithm for definite description resolution that incorporates a number of heuristics for detecting discourse-new (henceforth: DN) descriptions. 
2 Two sources of information for bridging reference resolution 2.1 Lexical information The use of different sources of lexical knowledge for resolving bridging references has been investigated in a series of papers by Poesio et al. all using as dataset the Bridging Descriptions (BDs) contained in the corpus used by Vieira and Poesio 3We make use of the classification of bridging references proposed by Vieira and Poesio (2000). 
5 Related Work Associative anaphora (e.g. , Poesio and Vieira, 1998) and indirect anaphora (e.g. , Murata and Nagao, 2000) are virtually the same phenomena that this paper is concerned with, as illustrated in (6).

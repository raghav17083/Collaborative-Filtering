However, the centering framework is not fully specified to handie complex sentences (Suri & McCoy, 1994). 
Suri and McCoy (1994) in their RAFT/RAPR approach use grammatical roles for ordering the focus lists and make a distinction between Subject Focus, Current Focus, and corresponding lists. 
As discussed in Section 2, Suri and McCoy (1994) suggested that afterand before-clauses behave more like embedding elements (i.e. , like complements) than like coordinating ones, and Cooreman and Sanford (1996) found evidence supporting this treatment for when clauses, as well. 
In particular, methods for the interaction between intraand intersentential anaphora resolution have to be defined, since the centering model is concerned only with the latter case (see Suri & McCoy (1994)). 
2.4 Revised Algorithms for Focus Tracking/Revised Algorithms for Pronoun Resolution Based on previous work (Suri and McCoy 1994), Suri, McCoy, and DeCristofaro (1999) propose a methodology of extending their Revised Algorithms for Focus Tracking/ Revised Algorithms for Pronoun Resolution (RAFT/RAPR) to handle focusing properties of complex sentences.

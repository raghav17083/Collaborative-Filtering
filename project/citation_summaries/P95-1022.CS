If the definite clause grammar is off-line parsable, and if the finite-state automaton is acyclic, then this computation can be guaranteed to terminate (van Noord 1995).


As to the parsing of word-graphs, it is wellknown that parsing algorithms for word strings can easily be generalized to word-graphs (e.g. van Noord 1995).

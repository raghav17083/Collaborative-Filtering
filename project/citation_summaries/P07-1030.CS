A few recently proposed concept acquisition methods require only a handful of seed words and no pattern pre-specification (Davidov et al., 2007; Pasca and Van Durme, 2008). 
As a pre-requisite to extracting relations among pairs of classes, the method described in (Davidov et al., 2007) extracts class instances from unstructured Web documents, by submitting pairs of instances as queries and analyzing the contents of the top 1,000 documents returned by a Web search engine. 
In the concept extension part of our algorithm we adapt our concept acquisition framework (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006; Davidov et al., 2007; Davidov and Rappoport, 2008a; Davidov and Rappoport, 2008b) to suit diverse languages, including ones without explicit word segmentation. 
Following (Davidov et al., 2007), we seek symmetric patterns to retrieve concept terms. 
Since (Hearst, 1992), who used a manually prepared set of initial lexical patterns in order to acquire relationships, numerous pattern-based methods have been proposed for the discovery of concepts from seeds (Pantel et al., 2004; Davidov et al., 2007; Pasca et al., 2006).

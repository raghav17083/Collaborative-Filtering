This lexical database architecture is described in more detail in Daelemans (1987a). 
The most common linguistic application for default inheritance is to encode lexical generalizations (e.g. , Boguraev and Pustejovsky 1990; Briscoe, Copestake, and Boguraev 1990; Vossen and Copestake 1993; Daelemans 1987; Evans and Gazdar 1989a, 1989b, 1996; Flickinger, Pollard, and Wasow 1985; Flickinger 1987; Flickinger and Nerbonne 1992; Kilgarriff 1993; Krieger and Nerbonne 1993; Sanfilippo 1993; Shieber 1986a), but defaults have also been used for specification in syntactic theory (e.g. , Gazdar 1987; Shieber 1986b), and for the analysis of gapping constructions (Kaplan 1987) and ellipsis (Grover et al. 1994). 
Another (more trivial) extension is the addition of preprocessors for the verbal expansion of abbreviations and numbers, 'rite specifications of a lexical attalyser providing this functionality were provided in Daelemans (1987b). 
And Daelemans (1987a,b, 1988) uses the object-oriented knowledge representation language KRS to implement default orthogonal inheritance networks for the lexical representation of phonological, orthographic, and morphological knowledge of Dutch and shows how such a lexicon architecture can be used for both language generation and automatic dictionary construction.

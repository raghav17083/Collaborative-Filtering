1 Introduction The natural language generation community has emphasized for a number of years the strengths of multilingual generation (MGEN) systems (Iordanskaja et al. , 1992; RTsner and Stede, 1992; Reiter and Mellish, 1993; Goldberg et al. , 1994; Paris et al. , 1995; Power and Scott, 1998). 
 Sentence planning different languages can express the same content in various rhetorical structures, and planning must take it into consideration: either by avoiding the tailoring of structure to a specific language [Rosner and Stede, 1994] or by taking advantage of knowledge on different realizations of rhetorical structures in different languages at the underlying representation [Delin et al. , 1994]. 
Other work has focused on the cross-linguistic realisations of two specific semantic relations (generation and enablement) (Delin et al. , 1994; Delia et al. , 1996), in a more general corpus of instructions for household appliances. 
MLG systems share a common architecture consisting of the following modules:  A language-independent underlying knowledge representation: knowledge represented as AI plans [Rosner and Stede, 1994] [Delin et al. , 1994], [Paris and Vander Linden, 1996], knowledge bases (or ontologies) such as LOOM, the Penman Upper-model and other (domain-specific) concepts and instances [Rosner and Stede, 1994]. 
The results in Section 3 strongly suggest that if one is to build text plans in the context of a JapaneseEnglish multilingual generation system, a languageindependent text planning module whose output is mapped straightforwardly into sentence plans (Iordanskaja et al. , 1992; Goldberg et al. , 1994) will not do.

The key requirement for parsing categorial systems formulated in this way is some theorem proving inethod that is sufficient for the fragment of linear logic employed (although some additional work will be required for managing labels), and a number of different approaches have been used, e.g. proof nets (Moortgat, 1992), and SLD resolution (Morrill, 1995). 
Firstly, directional types are labelled with span information using the labelling scheme of Morrill (1995) (which is justified in relation to relational algebraic models for the Lambek calculus (van Benthem, 1991)). 
These modifications, however, give a system which suffers 2See, for example, the formalisms developed in (Moortgat & Morrill, 1991), (Moortgat & Oehrle, 1994), (Morrill, 1994), (Hepple, 1995).

Morrill (1995) shows how types of the associative Lambek calculus may be translated to labelled implicational linear types, with deduction implemented via a version of SLD resolution.

In the similaritybased approaches (Dagan et al. , 1993 & 1994; Grishman et al. , 1993), rather than a class, each word is modelled by its own set of similar words derived from statistical data collected from corpora. 
Similarity-based smoothing (Hindle 1990; Brown et al. 1992; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999) provides an intuitively appealing approach to language modeling. 
This can be done by smoothing the observed frequencies (Church and Mercer, 1993), or by class-based methods (Brown et al. , 1991; Pereira and Tishby, 1992; Pereira et ah, 1993; Hirschman, 1986; Resnik, 1992; Brill et ah, 1990; Dagan et al. , 1993). 
5.2 Pseudo-Disambiguation Task Pseudo-disambiguation tasks have become a standard evaluation technique (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Sch utze 1992; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Sch utze 1998; Lee 1999; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999; Golding and Roth 1999; Rooth et al. 1999; EvenZohar and Roth 2000; Lee 2001; Clark and Weir 2002) and, in the current setting, we may use a nouns neighbors to decide which of two co-occurrences is the most likely. 
I)agan eL al. proposed a similarity-based model in which each word is generalized, not to its own specific class, but to a set of words which are most similar to it (Dagan et al. , 1993).

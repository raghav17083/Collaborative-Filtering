There has been an increasing number of such evaluations  e.g., (Reiter et al. , 2001, Paris et al. , 2001, Colineau et al. , 2002, Kushniruk et al. , 2002, Elhadad et al. , 2005)  and we should continue to encourage them as well as develop and share methodologies (and pitfalls) for performing these evaluations.

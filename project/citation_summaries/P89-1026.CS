3.1 Sentential Probability There is a strong relation between the speaker's speech act and the surface utterances expressing that speech act (Allen 1989 ; Andernach 1996). 
Domain and problemsolving actions have been investigated by many researchers (Allen and Perrault 1980; Perrault and Allen 1980; Wilensky 1981; Litman and Allen 1987; van Beek and Cohen 1986; Ramshaw 1989; Carberry 1990). 
Thus the parser computes a set of plausible speech act interpretation based on the surface form, similar to the model described in Hinkelman & Allen (1989). 
A number of researchers (Reichman 1978, 1985; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Polanyi 1986; Cohen 1987; Hirschberg and Litman 1987; Litman and Allen 1987; Schiffrin 1987; Hinkelman 1989; Litman and Hirschberg 1990; Knott and Dale 1994; Knott and Mellish 1996; Marcu 1997) have investigated the use in discourse of special words and phrases such as but, anyway, and by the way. 
that discourse structural information can be inferred from orthographic cues in text, such as paragraphing and punctuation; from linguistic cues in text or speech, such as cue PHI~.ASES 1 (Cohen, 1984; Reichman, 1985; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Passonneau and Litman, to appear) and other lexical cues (Hinkelman and Allen, 1989); from variation in referring expressions (Linde, 1979; Levy, 1984; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Webber, 1988; Song and Cohen, 1991; Passonneau and Litman, 1993), tense, and aspect (Schubert and Hwang, 1990; Song and Cohen, 1991); from knowledge of the domain, especially for taskoriented discourses (Grosz, 1978); and from speaker intentions (Carberry, 1990; Litman and Hirschberg, 1990; Lochbaum, 1994).

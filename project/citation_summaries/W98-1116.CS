Furthermore, it appears that the classes capture typological distinctions that are useful for machine translation (for example, causative unergatives are ungrammatical in many languages), as well as processing distinctions that are useful for generating naturally occurring language (for example, reduced relatives with unergative verbs are awkward, but they are acceptable, and in fact often preferred to full relatives for unaccusative and object-drop verbs) (Stevenson and Merlo 1997b; Merlo and Stevenson 1998).


For example, Merlo and Stevenson (1998) show that, contrary to the naive assumption, speakers' preferences in syntactic disambiguation are not simply directly related to frequency (i.e. , a speaker's preference for one construction over another is not simply modelled by the frequency of the construction, or of the words in the construction).


and CAUS ate slgmficantly different for unaccusattve and object-dtop verbs, indicating that we need additional featules that have different values across these two classes In Section 2 1, we noted the differing semantic role asmgnments for the verb classes, and hypothesized that these differences would affect the expression of syntactic features that ate countable in a corpus For example, the c ~bs feature approximates sen\]antic role reformation b.~ encoding the oxerlap beh~een nouns that can occur m the ~ubject and object positions of a cau~ative xetb Here x~e suggest another feature, that of ammacy of subject, that is intended to distinguish nouns that receive an Agent role flora those that receive a Theme role Recall that objectdrop verbs assign Agent to their subject in both the transitive and intransitive alternations, while unaccusattves assign Agent to their subject only in the transitive, and Theme m the intransitive We expect then that object-drop verbs will occur more often with an animate subject Note again that ~e are 20 II Features \[Acc% SE% II I VBD ACT INTR CAUS I 63 7 0 6 \] VBD ACT INTR CAUS PRO 70 7 0 4 Table 6 Percentage Accuracy (Acc%) and Standard Error

subjects, or reference to an on-hne resource such as WordNet for determining ammacy To approximate ammacy w~th a feature that can be extracted automatically, and w~thout reference to a resource external to the corpus, we instead count pronouns (other than ~t) m subject positron The assumptmn ~s that the words I, we, you, she, he, and they most often refer to ammate ent~tms The values for the new feature, P~.O, were determined by automatmally extracting all subject/verb tuples including our 59 examples verbs (from the WSJ88 parsed corpus), and computing the ratm of occurrences of pronouns to all subjects We again apply t-tests to our new data to determine whether the sets of PRo values d~ffer across the verb classes Interestingly, we find that the Prto values for unaccusat~ve verbs (the only class to ass~gn Theme role to the sub tect m one of tts alternatmns) are s~gmficantly dtffe~ent from those for both unergatlve and object-drop verbs (p< 05) Moreover, the PRo values for unergat~ve and object-drop verbs (whose subjects are Agents m bo~h alternatmns) are not s~gmficantly d~fferent Th~s pattern confirms the abd~ty of the feature to capture the thematm d~stmctmn between unaccusat~ve verbs and the other two classes Table 6 shows the result of applying C5 0 (10-fold eross-vahdatmn repeated 50 t~mes) to the three-x~ay classfficatmn task using the PRo feature m

object-drop verbs using the new feature m conjunctmn w~th the prevmus four leads to accuracy of over 68% (compared to 58% w~thout PRo) We conclude that this feature ~s ~mportant in d~stmgmshlng unaccusat~ve and object-drop verbs, and hkely contributes to the tmprovement m the three-way classtficatton because of th~s Future work wdl examine the performance w~thm the verb classes of th~s new set of features to see whether accuracy has also tmproved for unergatire verbs 5 Conclusions In thin paper, we have presented an m-depth case study, m whmh we investigate varmus machine learnmg techmques to automatically classify a set of verbs, based on dlstnbutmnal features extracted from a very large corpus Results show that a small number of hngmstlcally motivated grammatical features are sufficmnt to reduce the error rate by mote than 50% over chance, acluevmg a 70% acctuacy rate m a three-way classfficatmn task Tins leads us to conclude that corpus data is a usable repository of verb class mformatmn On one hand ~e observe that semantlc propemes of verb classes (such as causatlvlty, or ammacy of subject) may be usefully approximated through countable syntactic features Even with some noise, lexmal propertms are reflected m the corpus robustly enough to positively contribute m classlficatmn On the other hand, however, we remark that deep hngumtm analysis cannot be ehmmated--m our approach, it is embedded m the selection of the features to count We also think that using hngumtlcally motivated features makes the approach very effective and easdy scalable we report a 56% reductmn m error rate, w~th only five features that are relatwely straightforward to count Acknowledgements This research was partly sponsored by the S~ lss Natmnal Scmnce Foundatmn,

3 Which frequency dlstnbuUons work best to distinguish the verb classes ~ In exploring these quesUons, we focus on verb classlficaUon for several reasons Verbs are very important sources of knowledge in many language engineering tasks, and the relationships among verbs appear to play a major role m the orgamzatmn and use of this knowledge Knowledge about verb classes is crucml for lex,cal acqmsltton m support of language generation and machine translatmn (Dolt, 1997) and document cl~sfficatmn (Klavans and Kan, 1998), yet manual classfficauon of large numbers of verbs is a difficult and resource intensive task (Levm, 1993 Miller et al, 1990, Dang et al, 1998) To address these issues, we suggest that one can tram an automatic classffier for verbs on the basts of staUstmal approxlmaUons to verb dlatheses We use dlatheses--alternatmns m the expression of the arguments of the verb--following Levm and Dorr, for two reasons Fnst, verb dlatheses are syntacuc cues 1 We are aware that a dlstnbutmnal approach rests on one strong assumptmn regarding the nature of the representatmns under study semantic notmns and syntacuc notmns are correlated, at least m part This assurapuon is under debate (Bnscoe and Copestake, 1995, Levm, 1993, Dorr and Jones, 1996, Dorr, 1997), but we adopt ~t here without further dlscussmn 15 '  to semantic classes, hence they can be more easily captured by corpus-based techniques Second, using verb d~atheses reduces no,se There ~s a certain consensus (Bnscoe and Copestake, 1995, Pustejovsky, 1995, Palmer, 1999) that verb dmtheses are regular sense extensmns Hence focussing on thin type of classfficatmn allows one to abstract from the problem of word sense dmamb,guatmn and treat remdual d~fferences m word senses as no~se m the classfficatmn task We present an m-depth case study, m which we apply machine learning techmques to automaUcally classify a set of verbs based on d~stnbutmns of grammaucal indicators of dmtheses, extracted from a very large corpus We look at three very mterestmg classes of verbs unergaUves, unaccusauves, and obJect-drop verbs (Levm, 1993) These are Interestmg classes because they all parUcapate m the trans~uvlty alternatmn, and they are minimal parrs that as, a small number of well-defined dmtmctmns d~fferentmte their trans,tlve/mtranmUve behavmr Thus, we expect the differences m their dmtnbuttons to be small, entailing a fine-grained dlscr,mmaUon task that prowdes a challenging testbed for automatic classfficatmn The specffic theoretical questmn we mvesUgate ~s whether the factors underlying the verb class dmtmctmns are reflected m the statmttcal dmtnbutmns of lex~cal features related to dmtheses presented by the md,v~dual verbs m the corpus In doing th~s, we address the questmns above by determining what are the lexmal features that could d~stmgmsh the behavtor of the classes of verbs w~th respect to the relevant dmtheses, ~hmh of those features can be gleaned from the corpus, and which of those, once the staUstmal dmtnbutmns are available, can be used successfully by an automatic classifier In m~ttal work (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999), ~e found that hngmstlcally motivated features that d~stmgmsh the verb classes can be extracted from an annotated, and m one case parsed, corpus These features are sufficient to almost halve the error rate compared to chance (45% reductmn) m automaUc verb classtficaUon, suggesting that d~stnbuUonal data prowdes knowledge useful to the class~ficaUon of verbs The focus of our original stud~ was tho demonstration m prmctple of l~a.nmg verb classes from frequency d~stnbutmns ofsyntactm features, and an analysm of the relaUve contrtbutmn of the various features to learmng Th~s paper turns to the nnportant next steps of rephcatmg our findrags using other training methods and learning algorithms, and analyzing the performance on each of tbe three classes of verbs This more detailed analys~s of accuracy within each class m turn leads to the development of a new dlstrtbutmnal feature mtended to improve dlscnmmabthty among t~o of the classes The addltmn of the ne~ feature successfully reduces the error rate of out mltml results m classlficatmn by 19%, for a 56% overall reductmn m error rate compared to chance 2 Determining the Features In this sectmn, we present mouvatmn for the mttml features that we mvesUgated m terms of their role m learmng the verb classes We first present the hngmstlcally den~ed features then turn to e~tdence from experimental psychohngutstlcs to e\tend the set of potentially relevant features 2.1 Features of the Velb Classes The three verb classes under mvesugatmn unergaUves, unaccusaUves, and object-drop -differ m the properties of their translttve/mtranslhve

(2005) and Habash and Rambow (2006) who report an effort to analyze Arabic with such a multitape system based on work by Kiraz (2000, 2001) that relies on custom algorithms devised for a multitape alphabet. 
We also will develop a similar approach to handling dialectical Arabic speech using the MAGEAD morphological analyzer (Habash and Rambow, 2006). 
Much work has been done on automatic Arabic diacritization (Vergyri and Kirchhoff, 2004; Ananthakrishnan et al., 2005; Zitouni et al., 2006; Habash and Rambow, 2007). 
The system MAGEAD is another system of finite-state morphology developed for Arabic dialects (Habash and Rambow, 2006). 
To give an overview of some of the subsequent constraints that are still necessary, we include here a few descriptions and examples (where the starred (***) tape snippets exemplify illegal configurations):  Every root consonant has a matching consonant on the input tape T1 k a t a b a T2 k t b T1 k a t a b a T2*** d r s  A vowel in the input which is matched by a V in the pattern, must have a corresponding vocalization vowel T1 k a t a b a T4 C V C V C T7 a a T1 k a t a b a T4 C V C V C T7*** u i  A position where there is a symbol in the input either has a symbol in the pattern tape or a symbol in the affix tape (but not both) T1 k a t a b a T4 C V C V C T5 a T1 k a t a b a T4 C V C V C T5*** 7The idea to preserve the gemination in the grammar is similar to the solutions regarding gemination and spreading of Forms II, V, and IX documented in Beesley (1998b) and Habash and Rambow (2006).

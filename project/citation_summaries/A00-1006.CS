We plan to improve the accuracy obtained so far by exploring elementary techniques: (1) Adding new features including extra linguistic information such as the role of the speaker of the sentence (Yamada et al. , 2000) (also, the topic that sentences are referring to) may be effective; and (2) Considering the physical distance from the concerned input word, which may improve the accuracy.

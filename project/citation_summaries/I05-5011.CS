Recently, several algorithms were proposed for automatically learning entailment rules and paraphrases (viewed as bi-directional entailment rules) (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama et al., 2002; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005). 
To avoid the drawback, several linguistic clues, such as fine-grained classification of named entities and coordinated sentences, have been utilized (Sekine, 2005; Torisawa, 2006). 
Automatically Learning Entailment Rules from the Web Many algorithms for automatically learning paraphrases and entailment rules have been explored in recent years (Lin and Pantel, 2001; 1http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/index.html 67 Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama et al. , 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Sudo et al. , 2003; Szpektor et al. , 2004; Satoshi, 2005). 
2 Background A number of automatically acquired inference rule/paraphrase collections are available, such as (Szpektor et al., 2004), (Sekine, 2005). 
Indeed, the prominent approach for evaluating the quality of rule acquisition algorithms is by human judgment of the learned rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Shinyama et al. , 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Pang et al. , 2003; Szpektor et al. , 2004; Sekine, 2005).

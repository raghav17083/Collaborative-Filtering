A detailed comparison of this SGML-oriented architecture with more traditional data-base oriented architectures can be found in (McKelvie et al. , 1997).


Although the tools presented are deterministic and always produce a single annotation there is a way to incorporate multiple analyses into SGML structures using the hyperlinks described in (McKelvie et al. , 1997).

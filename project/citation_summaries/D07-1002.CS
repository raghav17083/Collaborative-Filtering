Resolving surface divergence of texts (e.g., voice of verbs and nominalizations) into unified semantic representations, SRL has attracted much attention from researchers into various NLP applications including question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004; Shen and Lapata, 2007; buy.v PropBank FrameNet Frame buy.01 Commerce buy Roles ARG0: buyer Buyer ARG1: thing bought Goods ARG2: seller Seller ARG3: paid Money ARG4: benefactive Recipient   Figure 1: A comparison of frames for buy.v defined in PropBank and FrameNet Moschitti et al., 2007), and information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003). 
For example, Shen and Lapata (2007) show the potential improvement that FrameNet can bring on the performance of a Question Answering (QA) system. 
Moreover, (Shen and Lapata, 2007; Moschitti et al., 2007; Surdeanu et al., 2008; Chali and Joty, 576 2008) have shown that shallow semantic information in the form of Predicate Argument Structures (PASs) (Jackendoff, 1990; Johnson and Fillmore, 2000) improves the automatic detection of correct answers to a target question. 
1 Introduction Recently, predicate argument structure analysis has attracted the attention of researchers because this information can increase the precision of text processing tasks, such as machine translation, information extraction (Hirschman et al., 1999), question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004) (Shen and Lapata, 2007), and summarization (Melli et al., 2005). 
Recent studies (e.g. Shen and Lapata (2007)) show that the use of FrameNet can potentially improve the performance of Question Answering systems.

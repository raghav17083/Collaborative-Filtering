Daniels Department of Linguistics Indiana University 402 Memorial Hall 1021 E Third Street Bloomington, IN 47405 daniels@ling.osu.edu 1 Introduction The Generalized ID/LP (GIDLP) grammar formalism (Daniels and Meurers 2004a,b; Daniels 2005) was developed to serve as a processing backbone for linearization-HPSG grammars, separating the declaration of the recursive constituent structure from the declaration of word order domains.


3 The GIDLP Parsing Algorithm The GIDLP parser Daniels and Meurers (2004a); Daniels (2005) is based on Earleys algorithm for 1For compactness, categories are described in this example with prolog-style terms; the actual GIDLP syntax assumes feature structure categories.

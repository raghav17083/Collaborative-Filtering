It is the interpretation of compounds, together with the closely related issue of structural disambiguation, which most researchers have addressed (Finin, 1980; Isabelle, 1984; Sparck Jones, 1983). 
77 1 Introduction The analysis of nominal compound constructions has proven to be a recalcitrant problem for linguistic semantics (Bergsten 1911, Jespersen 1942, Marchand 1970, Lees 1970, Downing 1977, Levi 1978, Warren 1987), and their analysis has presented a serious challenge for natural language processing systems (Finin 1980, McDonald 1982, Isabelle 1984, Alshawi 1987, Hobbs et al 1993, Bouillon et al 1992, Jones 1995, Johnston, Boguraev, and Pustejovsky 1995). 
Early attempts to automatically classify compound nouns have taken a semantic approach: Finin (1980) and Isabelle (1984) use role nominals derived from the head of the compound to ll a slot with the modi er. 
A considerable amount of effort has gone into specifying the set of semantic relations that hold between a compound head and its modifier (Levi 1978; Warren 1978; Finin 1980; Isabelle 1984). 
The previous work proposed semantic approaches based on semantic categories (Levi, 1978; Isabelle, 1984; Iida et al. , 1984) had proposed detailed analysis of relations between constituents in compound nouns.

While recent work on generation in restricted domains, such as (Belz, 2007), has shown promising results there remains much room for improvement particularly for broad coverage and robust generators, like those of Nakanishi et al. 
These rules can be handcrafted grammar rules, such as those of (LangkildeGeary, 2002; Carroll and Oepen, 2005), created semi-automatically (Belz, 2007) or, alternatively, extracted fully automatically from treebanks (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000; Nakanishi et al. , 2005; Cahill and van Genabith, 2006). 
Insofar as it is a broad coverage generator, which has been trained and tested on sections of the WSJ corpus, our generator is closer to the generators of (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000; Langkilde-Geary, 2002; Nakanishi et al. , 2005) than to those designed for more restricted domains such as weather forecast (Belz, 2007) and air travel domains (Ratnaparkhi, 2000).

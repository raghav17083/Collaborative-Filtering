The corpus of Vlachos and Gasperin (2006) contains 80 abstracts (600 sentences) annotated with gene names. 
We also use the baseNP identi cation in order to type the occurrence semantically and use this information in an anaphora resolution process (Gasperin, 2006).

In this spirit, we didn?t attempt any of the improvements discussed by Vlachos & Gasperin (2006) because they were based on observations on the behavior of the HMM-based system. 
The automatically generated corpus was created in order to bootstrap a gene name recognizer in Vlachos & Gasperin (2006).

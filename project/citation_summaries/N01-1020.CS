7.2 Cognates Mann and Yarowsky (2001) present a method for inducing translation lexicons based on trasduction modules of cognate pairs via bridge languages. 
For example, Mann and Yarowsky (2001) de ne a word pair (e, f) to be cognate if they are a translation pair (same meaning) and their Edit Distance is less than three (same form). 
Using the same models, Mann and Yarowsky (2001) induced over 90% of the Spanish-Portuguese cognate vocabulary. 
2 Related Work The literature on translation lexicon induction for low-density languages falls in to two broad categories: 1) Effectively utilizing similarity between languages by choosing a high-resource bridge language for translation (Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002) and 2) Extracting noisy clues (such as similar context) from monolingual corpora with help of a seed lexicon (Rapp, 1999; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002, Haghighi et al., 2008). 
Following previous researchers in computational linguistics (Bergsma and Kondrak, 2007; Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Melamed, 1999), however, we adopted a simplified definition which ignores origin, defining cognates as words in different languages that are mutual translations and have a similar orthography.

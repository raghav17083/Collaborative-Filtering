In particular, the problem of addressing definition questions has received great attention from the research community (Chen et al., 2006; Moschitti et al., 2007), while less research has been conducted so far on other types of non-factoid QA, such as whyquestions (Verberne et al., 2007; Pechsiri et al., 2008) and procedural (also called how-to) questions (Yin, 2006; Delpech and Saint-Dizier, 2008). 
In Question Answering, the latter problem is mostly tackled by using different heuristics and classifiers, which aim at extracting the best answers (Chen et al., 2006; Collins-Thompson et al., 2004). 
Indeed, the dialogue community has been addressing the problem of information seeking for decades, often with very satisfying commercial products able to interact not only in text but especially via spoken interfaces (Gupta et al., 2006; Traum, 1996). 
1 Introduction Question Answering (QA) is an IR task where the major complexity resides in question processing and answer extraction (Chen et al., 2006; CollinsThompson et al., 2004) rather than document retrieval (a step usually carried out by off-the shelf IR engines). 
Various studies (Chen et al., 2006; Han et al., 2006) illustrate the challenges introduced by de nition questions.

2 Coreference in the LaSIE system The LaSIE system (Gaizauskas et al. , 1995) has been designed as a general purpose IE system which can conform to the MUC task specifications for named entity identification, coreference resolution, IE template element and relation identification, and the construction of scenario-specific IE templates. 
is implemented within the general coreference mechanism provided by the LaSIE (Large Scale Information Extraction) system (Gaizauskas et al., 1995) and (Humphreys et al., 1998), Sheffield University's entry in the MUC-6 and 7 evaluations. 
To illustrate the process of converting pre-existing LE systems into GATE-compatible CREOLE sets we use as an example the creation of VIE (Vanilla Information Extraction system) from LaSIE (LargeScale Information Extraction system) (Gaizauskas et al. , 1995), Sheffield's entry in the MUC-6 system evaluations. 
3 Coreference in LaSIE The LaSIE system (Gaizauskas et al., 1995) and (Humphreys et al., 1998), has been designed as a general purpose IE system which can conform to the MUC task specifications for named entity identification, coreference resolution, IE template clement and relation identification, and the construction of scenario-specific IE templates. 
A more operational system using semantic representation of referents is for instance LaSIE (Gaizauskas et al. 1995), presented at MUC-6, which relies however a lot on task-dependent knowledge.

5 Related Work Though the evaluation of syntactic parsers has been a major concern in the parsing community, and a couple of works have recently presented the comparison of parsers based on different frameworks, their methods were based on the comparison of the parsing accuracy in terms of a certain intermediate parse representation (Ringger et al., 2004; Kaplan et al., 2004; Briscoe and Carroll, 2006; Clark and Curran, 2007; Miyao et al., 2007; Clegg and Shepherd, 2007; Pyysalo et al., 2007b; Pyysalo et al., 2007a; Sagae et al., 2008). 
Briscoe and Carroll (2006) discuss issues raised by this reannotation. 
4 Dependency Conversion to DepBank For the gold standard we chose the version of DepBank reannotated by Briscoe and Carroll (2006), consisting of 700 sentences from Section 23 of the Penn Treebank. 
The overall F-score for the CCG parser, 81.86%, is only 3 points below that for CCGbank, which pro1The GRs are arranged in a hierarchy, with those in Table 1 at the leaves; a small number of more general GRs subsume these (Briscoe and Carroll, 2006). 
Briscoe and Carroll (2006) give a rough comparison of RASP with the Parc LFG parser on the different versions of DepBank, obtaining similar results overall, but they acknowledge that the results are not strictly comparable because of the different annotation schemes used.

Part-of-speech tagging is an active area of research; a great deal of work has been done in this area over the past few years (e.g. , Jelinek 1985; Church 1988; Derose 1988; Hindle 1989; DeMarcken 1990; Merialdo 1994; Brill 1992; Black et al. 1992; Cutting et al. 1992; Kupiec 1992; Charniak et al. 1993; Weischedel et al. 1993; Schutze and Singer 1994). 
Endemic structural ambiguity, which can lead to such difficulties as trying to cope with the many thousands of possible parses that a grammar can assign to a sentence, can be greatly reduced by adding empirically derived probabilities to grammar rules (Fujisaki et al. 1989; Sharman, Jelinek, and Mercer 1990; Black et al. 1993) and by computing statistical measures of lexical association (Hindle and Rooth 1993). 
Almost all recent work in developing automatically trained part-of-speech taggers has been on further exploring Markovmodel based tagging (Jelinek 1985; Church 1988; Derose 1988; DeMarcken 1990; Merialdo 1994; Cutting et al. 1992; Kupiec 1992; Charniak et al. 1993; Weischedel et al. 1993; Schutze and Singer 1994). 
Sharman, Jelinek, and Mercer (1990) conducted a similar experiment with a grammar in ID/LP format (Gazdar et al. 1985; Sharman 1989). 
An effort has recently been undertaken to create automated machine translation systems in which the linguistic information needed for translation is extracted automatically from aligned corpora (Brown et al. 1990).

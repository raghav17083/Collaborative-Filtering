Of particular relevance to our method are the algorithms for semantic classification of names or NPs described in (Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Yangarber et al. , 2002). 
In response to this challenge, many researchers have investigated semi-supervised learning algorithms that learn from a (relatively small) set of labelled texts in conjunction with a (relatively large) set of unlabelled texts (e.g. , (Riloff, 1996; Brin, 1998; Yangarber et al. , 2002)). 
(Yangarber et al. , 2002) tried to discover names with a similar method. 
One school of extraction techniques concentrates on detecting the boundary of interesting entities in the text, (Califf and Mooney, 1997; Finn and Kushmerick, 2004; Yangarber et al. , 2002). 
(Yangarber et al. , 2002) presents the same technique successfully applied to learning names of entities of a given semantic class, e.g., diseases or infectious agents.6 The main differences are: a. the data-points in (Yangarber et al. , 2002) are instances of names in text (which are to be labeled with their semantic categories), whereas here the data-points are documents; b. the intended product there is a list of categorized names, whereas here the focus is on the patterns that categorize documents.

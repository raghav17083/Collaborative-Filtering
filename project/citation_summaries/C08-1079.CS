The feature combinations play an essential role in obtaining a classifier with state-of-the-art accuracy for several NLP tasks; recent examples include dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008), parse re-ranking (McClosky et al., 2006), pronoun resolution (Nguyen and Kim, 2008), and semantic role labeling (Liu and Sarkar, 2007).

Amalgam generates sentence strings from abstract predicate-argument structures (Figure 1), using a pipeline of stages, many of which employ machine-learned models to predict where to perform specific linguistic operations based on the linguistic context (Corston-Oliver et al. , 2002; Gamon et al. , 2002a, 2002b; Smets et al. , 2003).

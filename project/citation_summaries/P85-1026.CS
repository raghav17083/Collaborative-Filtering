There is strong empirical evidence (e.g. Goodman 1985) that people begin with referent identification immediately alter receiving initial information about it, instead of waiting tmtil the speaker's reti~rential act is terminated. 
Several correction strategies have been suggested:  Generalize a description by selectively ignoring some constraints (see Goodman 1985; McCoy 1985, 1986, 1988; Carberry 1988; Calistri-Yeh 1991; Eller and Carberry 1992),  Make a description more specific by adding extra constraints (see Eller and Carberry 1992), and  Choose a conceptual "sibling", by combining generalization and constraint operations. 
Cohen 1984), and as a process which is prone to various sorts of conversational failure (Goodman 1985). 
The inference of judgment plans must be sensitive to the fact that such a plan includes the constraint that the speaker found the judged plan to be in error even though the 11 If the error occurred in an instance of headnoun, a different replace-plan schema would need to be used, one that for instance relaxed the category that was used in describing the object (Goodman 1985; Heeman 1991). 
Goodman (1985) has addressed this problem for the case of when the referring expression overconstrains the choice of referent.

Ng (Ng, 2008) proposed a generative model for unsupervised coreference resolution that views coreference as an EM clustering process. 
forms both Poon and Domingos (2008) (an unsupervised Markov Logic Network system which uses explicit constraints) and Finkel and Manning (2008) (a supervised system which uses ILP inference to reconcile the predictions of a pairwise classifier) on all comparable measures.11 Similarly, on the ACE2004-NWIRE dataset, we also outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised system of Poon and Domingos (2008). 
(2007) and Bengston and Roth (2008). 
In the following we present some of the linguistic issues more problematic in relation to coreference annotation, and how we decided to deal with them in AnCora-CO (Recasens, 2008). 
Mention heads are determined by parsing the given mention span with the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and using the Collins head rules (Collins, 1999); Poon and Domingos (2008) showed that using syntactic heads strongly outperformed a simple rightmost headword rule.

Feature structures can be defined using a description language, such as the one found in PATR-II (Shieber 1986a) or in Kasper and Rounds (1986; 1990). 
This representation uses the logical formulation of feature structures as given by Kasper and Rounds (1986) and Johnson (1988) and is similar in approach to the logical formulation of Functional Unification Grammar (FUG) given by Rounds and Manaster-Ramer (1987). 
As Kasper (1986, 1987) noted in a different setting, the steps of the attribute-value unification algorithm are just applications of the axioms 1-3. 
Default unification is defined in terms of a formal language for feature structures, based on Kasper & Rounds' (1986) language FML. 
Rounds and Kasper introduced a logical formalism to describe feature structures with disjunctive specification (Kasper 1987; Kasper and Rounds 1986; Rounds and Kasper 1986).

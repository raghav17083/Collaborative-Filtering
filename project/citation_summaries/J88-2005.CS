2.1 Aspectual Markers and Constraints Certain features of a clause, such as the presence of adjuncts and tense, are constrained by and contribute to the aspectual class of the clause (Vendler 1967; Dowty 1979; Pustejovsky 1991; Passonneau 1988; Klavans 1994; Resnik 1996; Olsen and Resnik 1997). 
2 Related Work Temporal ordering has been extensively studied in computational linguistics (Passonneau, 1988; Webber, 1988; Hwang and Schubert, 1992; Lascarides and Asher, 1993; Lascarides and Oberlander, 1993). 
We used linguistic tests that were selected for this task by Passonneau (1988) from the constraints and entailments listed in Tables 2 and 3. 
The parameter-based approach borrows certain ideas from previous work such as the lexical-semantic model of Jackendoff (1983, 1990) and models of aspectual representation including Bach (1986), Comrie (1976), Dowty (1979), Mourelatos (1981), Passonneau (1988), Pustejovsky (1988, 1989, 1991), and Vendler (1967). 
Certain features of a clause, such as adjuncts and tense, are constrained by and contribute to the aspectual class of the clause (Vendler, 1967; Dowty, 1979; Pustejovsky, 1991; Passonneau, 1988; Klavans, 1994).

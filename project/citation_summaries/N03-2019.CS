Temporal analysis has also been applied in Question-Answering systems (Pustejovsky et al. , 2004; Schilder and Habel, 2003; Prager et al. , 2003), email classification (Kiritchenko et al. , 2004), aiding the precision of Information Retrieval results (Berlanga et al. , 2001), document summarisation (Mani and Wilson, 2000), time stamping of event clauses (Filatova and Hovy, 2001), temporal ordering of events (Mani et al. , 2003) and temporal reasoning from text (Boguraev and Ando, 2005; Moldovan et al. , 2005). 
Another component which will be developed will leverage document-level inference, as in the machine learning approach of (Mani et al. , 2003), which required annotation of a reference time (Reichenbach, 1947; Kamp and Reyle, 1993) for the event in each finite clause. 
Several automatic tools have been developed in conjunction with TimeML, including event taggers (Pustejovsky et al. 2003), time expression taggers (Mani and Wilson 2000), and an exploratory link extractor (Mani et al. 2003). 
2004), aiding the precision of Information Retrieval results (Berlanga et al. , 2001), document summarisation (Mani and Wilson, 2000), time stamping of event clauses (Filatova and Hovy, 2001), temporal ordering of events (Mani et al. , 2003) and temporal reasoning from text (Boguraev and Ando, 2005; Moldovan et al. , 2005). 
(Mani et al. 2003) obtained 80.2 F-measure training a decision tree on 2069 clauses in anchoring events to reference times that were inferred for each clause.

In prior research, ILP was used as a postprocessing step to remove redundancy and make other global decisions about parameters (McDonald, 2007; Marciniak and Strube, 2005; Clarke and Lapata, 2007). 
This framework is 211 commonly used in generation and summarization applications where the selection process is driven by multiple constraints (Marciniak and Strube, 2005; Clarke and Lapata, 2007). 
ILP models have been successfully applied in several natural language processing tasks, including relation extraction (Roth and Yih, 2004), semantic role labeling (Punyakanok et al. , 2004) and the generation of route directions (Marciniak and Strube, 2005). 
Using an ILP formulation may be an advantage here since we could use feedback (in the form of constraints) from other components and knowlegde sources (e.g. , discourse relations) to improve aggregation or indeed the generation pipeline as a whole (Marciniak and Strube, 2005). 
(Punyakanok et al. , 2005; Marciniak and Strube, 2005) also address some aspects of this problem.

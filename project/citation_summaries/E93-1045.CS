However, we know that derivations in TAGs are context-free (see (Vijay-Shanker, 1987)) and (VijayShanker and Weir, 1993) exhibits a CFG which represents all possible derivation sequences in a TAG. 
We show how to generate a derivation forest described by a set of context free rules (similar to (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993)) augmented by a stack of current adjunctions when a rule describes a spine traversal. 
fr Abstract In this paper 1 we present a new parsing algorithm for linear indexed grammars (LIGs) in the same spirit as the one described in (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993) for tree adjoining grammars. 
In (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993), the contextfreeness of adjunction in TAGs is captured by giving a CFG to represent the set of all possible derivation sequences. 
Other than the additional field, the algorithm remains essentially the same as the parsing algorithm described in (Schabes and Shieber, 1994), so it can be applied as a transducer during recognition, or as a post-process on a derivation forest (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993).

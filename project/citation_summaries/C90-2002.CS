This is a statistically-encoded structure o f all admissible semantic collocations associated with the lexical item . The initial seeding of the LS's is being done from lexical entries in the Longman Dictionary of Con temporary English [Proctor et al 1978], largely using tools described in [Wilks et al 1990] . These are then automatically adapted to the format of generative lexical structures . It is these lexical structures which ar e then statistically tuned against the corpus, following the methods outlined in [Pustejovsky 1992] and [Anic k and Pustejovsky 1990] . Semantic features for a lexical item which are missing or only partially specifie d from dictionary seeding are, where possible, induced from a semantic model of the corpus . 230 O.

(1994) and Marcu (1999) showed only that the discourse structures built by rhetorical parsers (Sumita et al. , 1992; Marcu, 1997) can be used successfully in order to improve retrieval performance and summarize text. 
In order to detenmne whether there exists any correspondence between what readers beheve to be important and the nuclea of the RS-trees, we selected, from each of the five texts, the set of textual umts that were labeled as "very Important" by a majority of the judges For example, for text (1), we selected umts 4 and 12, a e, 11% of the umts Overall, the judges selected 36 mats as being very amportant, whach as approximately 22% of the mats an a text The percentages of tmportant umts for the five texts were 11,36, 35, 17, and 22 respecuvely We took the maximal scores computed for each textual umt from the RS-trees bruit by each analyst and selected a percentage of umts that matched the percentage of Important umts selected by the judges In the cases m winch there were ues, we selected a percentage ofumts that was closest to the one computed for the judges For example, we selected umts 4 and 12, winch represented the most important 11% of umts as reduced from the RS-tree bruit by the first analyst However, we selected only  umt 4, winch represented 6% of the most Important umts as reduced from the RS-tree bmlt by the s.e~nd analyst The reason for selecting only umt 4 for the second analyst was that umts 10,11, and 12 have the same score -4 (see table I) If we had selected umts 10,11 and 12 as well, we wouldhave ended up selecting 22% of the umts m text (1), winch as farther from 11 than 6 Hence, we detenmned for each text the set of amportant umts as labeled byjudges and as denved from the RS-trees of those texts We calculated for each text the recall and precasaon of the important umts derived from the RS-trees, with respect to the umts labeled important by the judges The overall recall and precasaon was the same for both analysts 56% recall and 66% precision In contrast, the average recall and precasaon for the same percentages of umts selected randomly 1000 Umes from the same five texts were both 25 7%, o= 0 059 In summarizing text, at ~s often useful to consider not only clauses, but full sentences To account for tbJs, we consadered to be ~mportant all the textual units that pertinned to a sentence that was characterized by at least one amportant textual umt For example, we labeled as important textual umts 1 to 4 m text (I), because they make up a full sentence and because umt 4 was labeled as nnportant For the adjusted data, we detenmned agmn the percentages of amportant umts for the five texts and we re-calculated the recall and precasmn for both analysts the recall was 69% and 66% and the preclsaon 82% and 75% respectively In contrast, the average recall and precisaon for the same percentages of mats selected randomly 1000 ttmes from the same five texts were 38 4%, r = 0 048 These results confirm that there exasts a strong correlaUon between the nuclea of the RS-trees that pertmn to a text and what readers perceave as being amportant m that text Gaven the values of recall and precasaon that we obtained, at as plausible that an adequate computatmnal treatment of dxscourse theories would provide most of what is needed for selecting accurately the xmportant umts m a text However, the results also suggest that RST by atself as not enough if one wants to strive for peffecUon The above results not only provade strong evadence that chscourse theories can be used effecUvely for text summanzaUon, but also enable one to derive strategies that an automaUc summarizer naght follow For example, the Spearman correlauon coofficlent between the judges and the first analyst, the one who chd not follow the paragraph 85 structure, was lower than the one between the judges and the second analyst It follows that most humanjudges are mchned to use the paragraph breaks as valuable sources of mformaUon when they mterpret discourse If the mm ofa summanzaUon program ss to mmuc human behaxaor, ~t seems adequate for the program to take advantage of the paragraph structure of the texts that It analyzes Currently, the rank asstgnment for each textual umt m an RS-tree ts done enurely on the basts of the mammal depth m the tree where that umt as sahent (Marcu, 1996) Our data seem to support the fact that there exists a correlatmn also between the types of relatmus that are used to connect various textual umts and the tmportance of those umts m a text We plan to desagn other experiments that can provade clearcut evtdence on the nature of this correlauon 3 An RST-based summarization program 3.1 Implementation Our summanzauon program rehes on a rhetorical parser that braids RS-trees for unrestricted texts The mathemaUcal foundaUons of the rhetorical parsing algorithm rely on a first'order formahzaUon of vahd textl structures (Marcu, 1997h) The assumpUons of the formalazaUon are the following 1 The elementary umts of complex text structures are non-overlappmg spans of text 2 Rhetorical, coherence, and cohessve relauons hold between textual umts of various sizes 3 Rel~ons can be paruuoned into two classes paratacuc and hypotacuc Paratacuc relauons are those that hold between spans of equal ~mportanee HypotacUc relations are those that hold between a span that ts essenual for the writer's purpose, I e, a nucleus, and a span that increases the understanding of the nucleus but is not essenUal for the writer's purpose, ~ e, a satelhte 4 The abstract structure of most texts ts a binary, tree-lake structure 5 If a relaUon holds between two textual spans of the tree structure of a text, that relatton also holds between the most Important umts of the consUtuent subspans The most ~mportant umts of a textual span are determined recursavely they correspond to the most important umts of the tmmechate subspans when the relauon that holds between these subspans ts paratacUc, and to the most amportant umts of the nucleus subspan when the relauon that holds between the tmmedtate subspans as hypotaclac The rhetorical parsmg algorithm, which is outhned m figure l, is based on a comprehens|ve corpus analysisof more than 450 discourse markers and 7900 text fragments (see (Marcu, 199To) for detmls) When gwen a text, the rhetorical parser detenmnes first the &scourse markers and the elementary umts that make UP that text The parser uses then the mformatton derived from the corpus analysts m order to hypothesize rhetorical relaUons among the elementary umts In the end, the parser apphes a constrmnt-saUsfactmn procedure to deterrmne the text str~tures that are vahd If more than one val|d structure is found, the parser chooses one that ts the "best" accordmg to a gwen

Marcu (1997) parsed documents as rhetorical trees and identified important sentences based on the trees. 
In the approach proposed in (Marcu, 1997), for example, the presence of discourse markers is used to hypothesize individual textual units and relations holding between them. 
Marcu (Marcu 1997a) uses rhetorical structure analysis to guide the selection of text segments for the summary; similarly Teufel and Moens (Teufel & Moens 1997) analyze argumentative structure of discourse to extract appropriate sentences.

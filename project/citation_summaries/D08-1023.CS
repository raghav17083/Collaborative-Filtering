For instance, Blunsom and Osborne (2008) select the translation sentence with highest posterior probability under the model, summing over derivations. 
7Blunsom and Osborne (2008) described a related approach to approximate summing using the chart computed during cube pruning, but did not keep track of the residual terms as we do here. 
The version presented in (Blunsom and Osborne, 2008) operates on millions of rule count features analogous to our biphrase features, and integrates a language model into training and decoding. 
Approximate solutions have been proposed for that problem in several settings (Blunsom and Osborne, 2008; Sun and Tsujii, 2009); we leave their combination with our approach to future work. 
The approach most closely resembling ours is the independently developed global discriminative loglinear model based on synchronous context-free grammars (Blunsom and Osborne, 2008; Blunsom et al., 2008).

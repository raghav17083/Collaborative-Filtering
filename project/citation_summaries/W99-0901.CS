3Computational models of verb selectional preference have been evaluated through disambiguation tasks (Li and Abe, 1998; Abney and Light, 1999; Ciaramita and Johnson, 2000; Clark and Weir, 2002), but for to evaluate our cognitive model, the experiments from Resnik (1996) are the most interesting. 
2.2 Abney and Light's approach Atmey and Light (1999) pointed ouI; l;h~tt l;he distril)ution of se.llSeS of all anfl)iguous word is no|; unifornl. 
This is equivalent to the need for balancing as noted by Abney and Light (1999). 
These results were obtained for three systems (Resnik 1997; Abney and Light 1999; Ciaramita and Johnson 2000) on a training and test data set constructed by Resnik containing nouns occurring as direct objects of 100 verbs that select strongly for their objects. 
369 Selectional preferences of predicates have been modelled using the man-made thesaurus WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), see for example (Resnik, 1993; Li and Abe, 1998; Abney and Light, 1999; Clark and Weir, 2002).

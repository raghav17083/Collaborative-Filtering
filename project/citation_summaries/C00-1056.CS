Transliteration methods can be categorized into grapheme-based (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003; Li et al. , 2004), phoneme-based (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Jung et al. , 2000), and combined (Bilac and Tanaka, 2005) approaches. 
For example, (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003; Jung et al. , 2000) train English-Arabic and English-Korean generative transliteration models, respectively. 
Transliteration of a name, for the purpose of this work, is defined as its transcription in a different language, preserving the phonetics, perhaps in a different orthography [Knight and Graehl, 1997] 1 .  While traditional transliteration systems have relied on hand-crafted linguistic rules, more recently, statistical machine learning techniques have been shown to be effective in transliteration tasks [Jung et al., 2000] [AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003] [Virga  and Kudhanpur , 2003] [Haizhou et al., 2004]. 
2.1 Transliteration Framework The phoneme-based approach has received remarkable attention in the previous works (Meng et al. , 2001; Virga et al. , 2003; Knight et al. , 1998; Oh et al. , 2002; Sung et al. , 2000; Yaser et al. , 2002; Lee et al. , 2003). 
Several phoneme-based techniques have been proposed in the recent past for machine transliteration using transformation-based learning algorithm (Meng et al. , 2001; Jung et al. , 2000; Vigra and Khudanpur, 2003).

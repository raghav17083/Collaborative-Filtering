As mentioned earlier, Rayner and Carter (1996) describe a system that is the inspiration for global thresholding. 
* An automatic tuning of the grammar to the domain using the technique of ExplanationBased Learning (van Harmelen and Bundy, 1988; Rayner, 1988; Samuelsson and Rayner, 1991; Rayner and Carter, 1996). 
In (Rayner and Samuelsson, 1994, Rayner and Carter, 1996) grammar specialization is conducted by chunking the trees of a tree-bank according to "chunking criteria" which are manually specified e.g. chunks correspond to trees with roots which correspond to full utterances, NPs, PPs or non-recursive NPs. 
The examples given here are in fact all for Englis\]h, but the TreeBanker has also successfully been used for Swedish and French customizations of the CLE (Gambck and Rayner, 1992; Rayner, Carter and Bouillon, 1996). 
In contrast to our approach in which no manual annotation is required, Rayner and Carter (1996) report that for each sentence in the training data, the best parse was selected manually from the set of parses generated by the parser.

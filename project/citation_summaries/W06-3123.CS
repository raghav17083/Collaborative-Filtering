Previous phrase alignment work has primarily mitigated this tendency by constraining the inference procedure, for example with word alignments and linguistic features (Birch et al., 2006), or by disallowing large phrase pairs using a noncompositional constraint (Cherry and Lin, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008). 
Two are conditionalized phrasal models, each EM trained until performance degrades:  C-JPTM3 as described in (Birch et al. , 2006)  Phrasal ITG as described in Section 4.1 Three provide alignments for the surface heuristic:  GIZA++ with grow-diag-final (GDF)  Viterbi Phrasal ITG with and without the noncompositional constraint We use the Pharaoh decoder (Koehn et al. , 2003) with the SMT Shared Task baseline system (Koehn and Monz, 2006). 
4Interestingly, this is actually even the case for approaches that directly model alignments between phrases (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Birch et al. , 2006). 
Instead of employing word-alignment to guide phrase pair extraction, it is theoretically more appealing to aim at phrase alignment as part of the estimation process (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Birch et al., 2006). 
Birch et al (Birch et al., 2006) provide soft measures for including wordalignments in the estimation process and obtain improved results only on small data sets.

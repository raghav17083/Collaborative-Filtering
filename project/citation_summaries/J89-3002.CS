It is unrealistic to assume that word sense discrimination can be left until parsing is complete, as suggested, for example, by Dahlgren, McDowell, and Stabler (1989) and Janssen (1990). 
Most proposed solutions to this problem specify a fixed set of ordered rules that a system applies until a unique, satisfactory attachment is found (Fodor and Frazier 1980; Wilks, Huang, and Fass 1985; Shieber 1983; Hirst 1987; Dahlgren, McDowell, and Stabler 1989).

At present all this information is collected and coded by hand, although recent work by Ravin (1990) and Dahlgren, McDowell, and Stabler (1989) suggests that the collection of role-related information may be automatable. 
For example, Dahlgren, McDowell, and Stabler (1989) propose the rule "If the object of the preposition is an expression of time, then S-attach the PP" to explain the preference for assuming that "in the afternoon" modifies adjourn in Example 2: Example 2 The judge adjourned the hearing in the afternoon.

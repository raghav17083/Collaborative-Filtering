Some recent, works lmve rel)orted thai; tagging a('curacy could l)e iml)roved 1)y using lexicM intbrnml;ion in their models such as the transtbrmation-based patch rules(Brill, 1994), the ln~txinnun entropy model(lIatn~q)arkhi, 1996), the statistical lexical ruh:s(Lee et al. , 1999), the IIMM considering multi-words(Kim, 1996), the selectively lexicalized HMM(Kim et al. , 1999), and so on.


In the l)revious works(Kim, 1996)(Kim et al. , 1999), however, their ItMMs were lexicalized seh:ctively and resl;rictively.

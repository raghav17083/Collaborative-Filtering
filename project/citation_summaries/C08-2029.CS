Pr(fi) is the selection probability of a specic attribute fi (SP(a) in (Spanger et al., 2008)).


The constraint on minimality has, however, been relaxed due to the computational complexity of generation, the perceived naturalness of redundant expressions, and the easiness of understanding them (e.g., (Dale and Reiter, 1995; Spanger et al., 2008)).

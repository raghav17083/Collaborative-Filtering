B. The Parser The parser used in the NLMenu system is an implementation of an enhanced version of the modified left-corner algorithm described in Ross (1982).


Ross (1982) is a continuation of the work described in Ross (1981) and builds on that work and on the work of Griffiths and Petrick (1965).

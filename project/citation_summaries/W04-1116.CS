The details of supplementary principles, symbol illustrations, semantic roles, phrasal structures and applications of the CCTB can be found in (CCTB portal; Chen et al. , 2003; Chen and Hsieh, 2004; You and Chen, 2004).


In practice, for example, the semantic roles in the Sinica Treebank mark not only verbal arguments but also modifier-head relations (You and Chen, 2004).


Its limited function in training, for instance, is reflected in the low coverage reported (e.g. You and Chen, 2004).

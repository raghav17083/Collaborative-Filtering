U-DOP and UML-DOP are the results reported in Bod (2006b) and Bod (2006a) respectively. 
These include CCM (Klein and Manning, 2002), the DMV and DMV+CCM models (Klein and Manning, 2004), (U)DOP based models (Bod, 2006a; Bod, 2006b; Bod, 2007), an exemplar based approach (Dennis, 2005), guiding EM using contrastive estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2006), and the incremental parser of Seginer (2007) which we use here. 
The last decade has seen significant progress in this field of research (Klein and Manning, 2002; Klein and Manning, 2004; Bod, 2006a; Bod, 2006b; Smith and Eisner, 2006; Seginer, 2007). 
mar. Most recent work (e.g., (Klein and Manning, 2004; Dennis, 2005; Bod, 2006a; Smith and Eisner, 2006; Seginer, 2007)) annotates text sentences using a hierarchical bracketing (constituents) or a dependency structure, and thus represents the induced grammar through its behavior in a parsing task. 
U-DOP therefore randomly samples a large subset from the total number of parse trees from the chart (see Bod 2006) and next converts the subtrees from these parse trees into a PCFG-reduction (Goodman 2003).

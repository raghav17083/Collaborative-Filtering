Tsarfaty (2006) used a morphological analyzer (Segal, 2000), a PoS tagger (Bar-Haim et al., 2005), and a general purpose parser (Schmid, 2000) in an integrated framework in which morphological and syntactic components interact to share information, leading to improved performance on the joint task. 
In sequential tagging models such as (Adler and Elhadad, 2006; Bar-Haim et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2005) weights are assigned according to a language model based on linear context. 
This is by now a fairly standard representation for multiple morphological segmentation of Hebrew utterances (Adler, 2001; Bar-Haim et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2005; Cohen and Smith, 2007; Adler, 2007). 
There are also morphological disambiguators designed specifically for Hebrew (Segal, 2000; Bar-Haim et al. , 2005). 
(Bar-Haim et al., 2007; Habash and Rambow, 2005)) and probabilities are assigned to different analyses in accordance with the likelihood of their tags (e.g.,  fmnh is 30% likely to be tagged NN and 70% likely to be tagged REL+VB ).

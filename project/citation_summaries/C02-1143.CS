This may be a language-dependent feature, as other experiments indicate that additional linguistic pre-processing does not necessarily improve tagging accuracy for languages like Chinese (Dang et al. , 2002). 
Five verbs, the first five listed in Table 1, are both highly polysemous and difficult for a supervised word sense classifier (Dang et al. , 2002). 
The top five verbs are verbs that were identified as difficult verbs in Dang et als (2002) experiments. 
The estimated probability is derived from feature weights which are determined automatically from training data so as to produce a probability distribution that has maximum entropy, under the constraint that it is consistent with observed evidence (Dang et al. , 2002). 
Bayesian learning (Leacock et al. , 1998), exemplar based learning (Ng and Lee, 1996), decision list (Yarowsky, 2000), neural network (Towel and Voorheest, 1998), maximum entropy method (Dang et al. , 2002), etc In this paper, we employ Naive Bayes classifier to perform WSD.

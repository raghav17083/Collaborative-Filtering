One problem is coverage: Most previous work has focused on acquiring selectional preferences for verbs and applying them to disambiguate nouns occurring at subject and direct object slots (Ribas 1995; McCarthy 1997; Abney and Light 1999; Ciaramita and Johnson 2000; Stevenson and Wilks 2001). 
We believe that an automatic means of finding a predominant sense would be useful for systems that use it as a means of backing-off (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998; Hoste et al. , 2001) and for systems that use it in lexical acquisition (McCarthy, 1997; Merlo and Leybold, 2001; Korhonen, 2002) because of the limited size of hand-tagged resources. 
So although it is now possible to extract at least subcategorisation data from large corpora 2 with 2Grishman & Sterling (1992), Poznanski & Sanfilippo (1993), Resnik (1993), Pdbas (1994), McCarthy (1997) and others have shown that it is possible also to a119 some degree of reliability, it would be difficult to integrate the data into this type of parsing system. 
In recent years, a number of approaches have been proposed for dealing computationally with selectional preference acquisition (Resnik (1996); Briscoe and Carroll (1997); McCarthy (1997); Rooth et al.

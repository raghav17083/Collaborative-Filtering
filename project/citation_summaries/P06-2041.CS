The basic idea of deterministic parsing is using a greedy parsing algorithm that approximates a globally optimal solution by making a sequence of locally optimal choices (Hall et al. , 2006). 
We notice in particular that, given the lack of nonprojective cases/rules, theparser ofHall et al.(2006) is almost identical to our parser, hence the difference in accuracy (+1.1%) might effectively be due to a better classifier. 
The dominant learning method in this tradition is support vector machines (Kudo and Matsumoto 2002; Yamada and Matsumoto 2003; Nivre et al. 2006) but memory-based learning has also been used (Nivre, Hall, and Nilsson 2004; Nivre and Scholz 2004; Attardi 2006). 
Transitionbased parsers model the sequence of decisions of a shift-reduce parser, given previous decisions and current state, and parsing is performed by greedily choosing the highest scoring transition out of each successive parsing state or by searching for the best sequence of transitions (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2004; Sagae and Lavie, 2005; Hall et al., 2006). 
Altogether it has now been applied to 19 different languages (Nivre et al. 2006, 2007; Hall et al. 2007).

3.3 Source Channel Model Source channel model has been widely used for spelling correction (Kernigham et al. , 1990; Mayes, Damerau et al. , 1991; Brill and More, 2000; Ahmad and Kondrak, 2005). 
41 Acknowledgments Michael Glass of Valparaiso University graciously supplied the unigram and bigram counts needed to implement Kernighan et al.s (1990) spelling correction algorithm. 
3 Approach Our spelling system follows a noisy channel model of spelling errors (Kernighan et al., 1990). 
In this section, students were asked to duplicate the calculations used in Kernighan et al.s (1990) Bayesian approach to spelling correction, as explained in Section 5.5 of the textbook. 
1 Introduction The noisy channel model approach is being successfully applied to various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as speech recognition (Jelinek, 1985), spelling correction (Kernighan et al. , 1990), machine translation (Brown et al. , 1990), etc. In this approach an NLP system is composed of two modules: one is a taskdependent part (an acoustic model for speech recognition) which describes a relationship between an input signal sequence and a word, the other is a language model (LM) which measures the likelihood of a sequence of words as a sentence in the language.

5 Discussion As Muller (2001a), we presented a method for prediction of syllable boundaries using phonological probabilistic context-free grammars for German. However, our approach performs slightly better (96.88% word accuracy on word tokens versus 96.49%). 
2 Method We build on the approach of Muller (2001) which combines the advantages of treebank and bracketed corpora training. 
3.3 Unigram syllable adaptor grammar PCFG estimation procedures have been used to model the supervised and unsupervised acquisition of syllable structure (Muller, 2001; Muller, 2002); and the best performance in unsupervised acquisition is obtained using a grammar that encodes linguistically detailed properties of syllables whose rules are inferred using a fairly complex algorithm (Goldwater and Johnson, 2005). 
2 Method We build on the novel approach of Muller (2001a) which aims to combine the advantages of treebank and bracketed corpora training. 
We find that the first grammar (Muller, 2001) achieves 85.45% word accuracy, 88.94% syllable accuracy and 94.37% syllable boundary accuracy for English and 84.21%, 90.86%, 95.36% for German respectively.

We utilize the techniques for robust language modelling and multimodal understanding described in Bangalore and Johnston (2004). 
5.1 Basic edit Our baseline, the edit machine described in (Bangalore and Johnston, 2004), is essentially a finitestate implementation of the algorithm to compute the Levenshtein distance. 
For speech recognition, a corpus-driven stochastic language model (SLM) with smoothing or a combination of grammarbased and a0 -gram model (Bangalore and Johnston, 2004; Wang et al. , 2002) can be built in order to overcome the brittleness of a grammar-based language model.

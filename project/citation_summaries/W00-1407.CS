Following argumentation theory, we have designed an argumentative strategy for generating evaluative arguments that are properly arranged and concise (Carenini and Moore 2000). 
User model: The first algorithm utilizes decision-theoretic user models to provide an attribute ranking specific to each user (Carenini and Moore, 2000). 
For example, the UDF video output with an average polarity/strength of near -3 might be realized as several customers found the video output to be terrible. While experimenting with the SEA summarizer, we noticed that the document structuring of SEA summaries, which is adapted from GEA and is based on guidelines from argumentation theory (Carenini and Moore, 2000), sometimes sounded unnatural. 
2.1), using clustering methods as described in (Polifroni et al., 2003) The weights from the user model and the scalar values for the attributes in the user model yield an overall utility U for a cluster h, similar to utilities as calculated for individual entities (Edwards and Barron, 1994; Carenini and Moore, 2000): Uh = Ksummationdisplay k=1 wk(xhk) We use cluster size scoring with Refiner ranking and utility scoring with user model ranking. 
A set of plan operators, implementing guidelines for content selection and organ(sat(on from argumentation theory (Carenini and Moore 2000).

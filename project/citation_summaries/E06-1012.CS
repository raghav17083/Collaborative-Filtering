2 Dependency Parsing for Thai The dependency structure for Thai is more flexible than some languages like Japanese (Sekine et al., 2000), Turkish (Eryigit and Oflazer, 2006), while it is close to Chinese (Cheng et al., 2005) and English (Nivre and Scholz, 2004). 
The Turkish treebank therefore divides word forms into smaller units, called inflectional groups (IGs), and the task of the parser is to construct dependencies between IGs, not (primarily) between word forms (Eryigit and Oflazer, 2006). 
The dependency structure of Turkish has been mentioned in many studies (Oflazer et al. , 2003; Oflazer, 2003; Eryigit et al. , 2006) and it is argued that for Turkish, it is not just enough to determine the relationships between words and one should also determine the relationships between inflectional groups. 
Statistics from the Turkish Treebank indicate that for sentences ranging between 2 words to 40 words (with an average of about 8 words), the number of IGs range from 2 to 55 IGs (with an average of 10 IGs per sentence) (Eryigit and Oflazer, 2006). 
There are even studies showing that lexicalization can be harmful when parsing richly inflected languages like German (Dubey and Keller, 2003) and Turkish (Eryigit and Oflazer, 2006).

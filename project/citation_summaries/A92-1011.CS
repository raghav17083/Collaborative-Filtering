However, advances in the area of automatic thesaurus discovery (Grefenstette, 1994) as well as progress in the area of automatic merger of machine readable dictionaries (Sanfilippo & Poznanski, 1992; Chang & Chen, 1997) indicate that availability of the lexical resources needed may gradually improve in the future. 
Other approaches Sanfilippo and Poznanski (1992) proposed a so-caUed Dictionary Correlation Kit (DCK) in a dialog-based environment for correlating word senses across pairs of MRDs, LDOCE and LLOCE. 
The work of Sanfilippo and Poznanski (1992) is more closely related to our approach in that it attempts to recover a syntactic-semantic relation from machine-readable dictionaries. 
Other Approaches Sanfilippo and Poznanski (1992) propose a so-called dictionary correlation kit (DCK) in a dialogue-based environment for correlating word senses across a pair of MRDs such as the LDOCE and the LLOCE. 
Sanfilippo and Poznanski (1992) describe the semi-automatic derivation of entries for English psychological predicates by augmenting LDOCE with thesaurus information derived from the Longman Lexicon.

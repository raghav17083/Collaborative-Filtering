As an example of such a unifying approach, (Roth,2000) shows thatseveral different algorithms (memory-based learning, tbl, snow, decision lists, various statistical learners, ) use the same type of knowledge representation, a linear representation overafeaturespacebasedonatransformation ofthe original instance space.

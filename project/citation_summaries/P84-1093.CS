Recent work on machine-readable dictionaries offers new and interesting possibilities both for the computerassisted lexicology (see Walker 1984) and for constructing lexical databases derived from the definitions in machine-readable dictionaries and utilized in NLP along with other fields (see Amsler 1982, 1984a; Walker, Amsler 1986, Calzolari 1984a,b).

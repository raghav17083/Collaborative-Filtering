The CPMS based method for calculating surface similarity takes into account order sensitivity as well as scaling (Heeringa et al., 2006; Ellison and Kirby, 2006). 
In such a situation, the ability to quantitatively measure the similarities and differences among languages as well as dialects (Dyen et al., 1992; Nerbonne and Heeringa, 1997; Kondrak, 2002; Ellison and Kirby, 2006) can be very important, not only for providing evidence for or against a variety being a language or a dialect, but also for the more practical purpose of building resources for all these varieties, </context> <context>ynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm (Myers and Rabiner, 1981). 
To the best of our knowledge, Schulte im Walde (2006) is the only hard-clustering approach that previously incorporated selectional preferences as verb features.

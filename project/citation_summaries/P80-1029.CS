In ATNSYS (Cappelli, Ferrari, Moretti, Prodanof and Stock, 1978), a previously constructed ATN based system (Woods, 1970), a special dynamic reordering mechanism was introduced in order to get sooner to a correct syntactic analysis, when parsing sentences of a coherent text (Ferrari and Stock, 1980).

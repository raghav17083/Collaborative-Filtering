For example, the accuracy/purity measure (Stevenson and Joanis 2003; Korhonen, Krymolowski, and Marx 2003) evaluates whether a verb is assigned to a correct cluster with respect to the gold standard class of the majority of cluster members. 
(Stevenson and Joanis, 2003) investigate the applicability of this general feature space to unsupervised verb clustering tasks. 
The present work inherits the spirit of the supervised approaches to verb classification (Stevenson et al., 1999; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Stevenson and Joanis, 2003; Joanis and Stevenson, 2003; Joanis et al., 2008). 
Our model is evaluated in two tasks of typelevel verb classification: one is the classification of monosemous verbs into a small subset of the classes, which was studied in some previous works (Joanis and Stevenson, 2003; Joanis et al., 2008). 
For this reason, various methods for automatically classifying verbs using machine learning techniques have been attempted ((Merlo and Stevenson, 2001), (Stevenson and Joanis, 2003), (Schulte im Walde, 2003)).

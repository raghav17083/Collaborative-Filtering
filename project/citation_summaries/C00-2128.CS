In contrast to Utiyama et al. , we use no information external to the corpus (e.g. , a thesaurus); sparse-data problems are tackled via independence assumptions, and syntactic information is obtained through shallow text analysis (Utiyama, Murata, and Isahara (2000) rely on morphological analysis to provide cues for syntactic information).

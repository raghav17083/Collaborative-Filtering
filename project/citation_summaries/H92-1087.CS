The POS-tagged corpus has also been used to train a number of different POS taggers including Meteer, Schwartz, and Weischedel (1991), and the skeletally parsed corpus has been used in connection with the development of new methods to exploit intonational cues in disambiguating the parsing of spoken sentences (Veilleux and Ostendorf 1992).

2 Approach 2.1 Data We conducted our experiments on the recently released Spontaneous Speech Reconstruction (SSR) corpus (Fitzgerald and Jelinek, 2008), a mediumsized set of disfluency annotations atop Fisher conversational telephone speech data (Cieri et al., 2004)1. 
 Features #1 and #2 are the two methods included in a similar though less exhaustive effort by (Fitzgerald and Jelinek, 2008) in error filtering for the creation of the SSR corpus itself. 
In machine-learning tasks, disfluency is sought to be automatically removed by learning from disfluency-marked corpora or corpora of text edits (Haji et al., 2008; Fitzgerald and Jelinek, 2008) to smooth the input text into written-language standard before parsing. 
2 Approach 2.1 Data We conducted our experiments on the recently released Spontaneous Speech Reconstruction (SSR) corpus (Fitzgerald and Jelinek, 2008), a mediumsized set of disfluency annotations atop Fisher conversational telephone speech (CTS) data (Cieri et al., 2004). 
(2009) (referred here as FHJ) used conditional random fields (CRFs) and the Spontaneous Speech Reconstruction (SSR) corpus (Fitzgerald and Jelinek, 2008) corpus for wordlevel error identification, especially targeting improvement of these non-copy errors.

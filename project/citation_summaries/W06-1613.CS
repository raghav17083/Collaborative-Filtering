689 Cluster Nodes Edges DP 167 323 PBMT 186 516 Summ 839 1425 QA 238 202 TE 56 44 Table 1: Clusters and their citation network size 1.1 Related Work Although there has been work on analyzing citation and collaboration networks (Teufel et al., 2006; Newman, 2001) and scientific article summarization (Teufel and Moens, 2002), to the knowledge of the author there is no previous work that study the text of the citation summaries to produce a summary. 
And automatic citation classification (Nanba and Okumura, 1999; Teufel et al. , 2006) determines the function that a citation plays in the discourse. 
Work on applying machine learning techniques for automatic citation classi cation is currently underway (Teufel et al. , 2006); the agreement of one annotator and the system is currently K=.57, leaving plenty of room for improvement in comparison with the human annotation results presented here. 
Even though prior work (Teufel et al., 2006) argues that citation text is unsuitable for summarization, we show that in the framework of multi-document survey creation, citation texts can play a crucial role. 
That means that parts of the AZ scheme are similar to citation function classification schemes from the area of citation content analysis (Garfield, 1965; Weinstock, 1971; Spiegel-Rusing, 1977), and to automatic citation function classification (Nanba and Okumura, 1999; Garzone and Mercer, 2000; Teufel et al., 2006).

Kaplan and Wedekind (2000) show that for certain linguistically interesting classes of LFG (and PATR etc). 
 Atomic-valued features describe linguistic properties of the predicate, such as TENSE, ASPECT, MOOD, PERS, NUM, CASE etc. 2.2 Generation from F-Structures Work on generation in LFG generally assumes that the generation task is to determine the set of strings of the language that corresponds to a specified fstructure, given a particular grammar (Kaplan and Wedekind, 2000). 
The proof builds on Kaplan and Wedekinds (2000) construction showing that LFG generation produces contextfree languages. 
Kaplan and Wedekind (2000) proved that the set of strings generated by an LFG grammar from fully specified f-structures is a context-free language.

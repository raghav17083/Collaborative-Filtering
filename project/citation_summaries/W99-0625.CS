2.1 Simpli cation and Clustering We use SimFinder (Hatzivassiloglou et al. , 1999) for sentence clustering and its similarity metric to evaluate cluster quality; SimFinder outputs similarity values (simvals) between 0 and 1 for pairs of sentences, based on word overlap, synonymy and n-gram matches. 
SimFinder (Hatzivassiloglou et al. , 1999; Hatzivassiloglou et al. , 2001) examined 43 different features that could potentially help determine the similarity of two short text units (sentences or paragraphs). 
The need to determine the importance of a particular concept within a document is motivated by a range of applications, including information retrieval \[Salton 1989\], 303 automatic determination of authorship \[Mosteller and Wallace 1963\], similarity metrics for cross-document clustering \[Hatzivassiloglou et al. 1999\], automatic indexing \[Hodges et al. 1996\] and input to summarization \[Paice 1990\]. 
To this end, we intend to implement a second-pass analysis that would rerank the candidates produced by fuzzy inverted generation by computing text similarities over short passages such as those proposed in (Hatzivassiloglou et al. , 1999). 
We use SimFinder (Hatzivassiloglou et al. , 1999) for sentence clustering and the f-measure for word overlap to compare noun phrases.

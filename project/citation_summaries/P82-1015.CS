In EPISTLE, (a) the core grammar consists at present of a set of about 300 syntax rules; (b) ambiguity is resolved by using a metric that ranks alternative parses (Heidorn 1982): and (c) parse failure is handled by the fitting procedure described here. 
This is undoubtedly a useful strategy -one which EPISTLE makes use of, in fact, in its rules for detecting grammatical errors (Heidorn et al. 1982).

The syntactically-oriented group includes robust parsers based on Augmented Transition Networks (ATN) which Use the relaxation technique/Kwansny 1981./or the meta-rule/Weisehedel 1980, 82, 87/, and the EPISTLE system which addresses the problems of the checking grammar and style of texts, such as letters, reports and manuals, written in ordinary English/Heidorn 1982/, /Jensen 1983/.

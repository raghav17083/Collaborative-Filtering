For example, the use of parallel corpora for sense tagging can help with word sense disambiguation (Brown et al. , 1991; Dagan, 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994; Ide, 2000; Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999). 
These methods have been used in machine translation (Brown et al. , 1990; Sadler, 1989), terminology research and translation aids (Isabelle, 1992; Ogden and Gonzales, 1993), bilingual lexicography (Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990), collocation studies (Smadja, 1992), word-sense disambiguation (Brown et al. , 1991b; Gale et al. , 1992) and information retrieval in a multilingual environment (Landauer and Littman, 1990). 
This can be done by smoothing the observed frequencies 7 (Church and Mercer 1993) or by class-based methods (Brown et al. 1991; Pereira and Tishby 1992; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Hirschman 1986; Resnik 1992; Brill et al. 1990; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993). 
3 Bilingual Task: An Application for Word Alignment 3.1 Sentence and word alignment Bilingual alignment methods (Warwick et al. , 1990; Brown et al. , 1991a; Brown et al. , 1993; Gale and Church, 1991b; Gale and Church, 1991a; Kay and Roscheisen, 1993; Simard et al. , 1992; Church, 1993; Kupiec, 1993a; Matsumoto et al. , 1993; Dagan et al. , 1993). 
More recently, Gale and Church (1991a) describe an algorithm similar to the one described in Brown et al.

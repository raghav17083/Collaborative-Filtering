In order to generate QUABs automatically, documents identified from FERRETs automatic Q/A system are first submitted to a Topic Representation module, which computes both topic signatures (Lin and Hovy, 2000) and enhanced topic signatures (Harabagiu, 2004) in order to identify a set of topic-relevant passages. 
More advanced methods for query expansion use topic signatures  words and grammatically related pairs of words that model the query and even the expected answer from sets of documents marked as relevant or not (Lin & Hovy, 2000; Harabagiu, 2004). 
sembled, topic signatures (Lin and Hovy, 2000; Harabagiu 2004) are computed which identify the set of topic-relevant concepts and relations between concepts that are found in the relevant set of documents. 
Since seed relations are by definition relevant to a particular subtopic, they can be used to determine a binary partition of the document collection a4 into (1) a relevant set of documents a5a6a1 (that is, the documents relevant to relation a0 a1 ) and (2) a set of non-relevant documents a4 -a5a6a1 . Inspired by the method presented in (Yangarber et al. , 2000), a topic signature (as calculated by (Harabagiu, 2004)) is then produced for the set of documents in a5a7a1 . For each subtopic a3 a1 defined as part of the dialogue scenario, documents relevant to a corresponding seed relation a0 a1 are added to a5 iff the relation a0a8a1 meets the density criterion (as defined in (Yangarber et al. , 2000)). 
Under this approach, topic representations like those introduced in (Lin and Hovy, 2000) and (Harabagiu, 2004) are used to identify a set of text passages that are relevant to a users domain of interest.

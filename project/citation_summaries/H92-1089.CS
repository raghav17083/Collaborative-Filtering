For example, phrases beginning discourse segments were correlated with preceding pause duration in (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; ttirschberg and Grosz, 1992). 
Grosz and Hirschberg (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992) asked subjects to structure three AP news stories (averaging 450 words in length) according to the model of Grosz and Sidner (1986). 
An intention-based theory of discourse was used in (Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992) to identify intonational correlates of discourse structure in news stories read by a professional speaker. 
PAUSES Grosz and Hirschberg (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992) found that in a corpus of recordings of AP news texts, phrases beginning discourse segments are correlated with duration of preceding pauses, while phrases ending discourse segments are correlated with subsequent pauses. 
Grosz and Hirschberg (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992) derived a discourse structure for each text in their study, by incorporating the structural features agreed upon by all of their subjects.

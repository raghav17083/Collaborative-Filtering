W96-0305:1	45:175	Moreover, those relations have been shown to be very effective knowledge sources for WSD (McRoy 1992) and interpretation of noun sequences (Vanderwende 1994).
---------------------------------------------------
W06-1208:2	25:152	Vanderwende (1994) uses a rule based technique that scores a compound on possible semantic interpretations, while Jones (1995) implements a graph based uni cation procedure over semantic feature structures for the head.
---------------------------------------------------
J06-3003:3	694:729	Other researchers have proposed different schemes (Vanderwende 1994; Barker and Szpakowicz 1998; Rosario and Hearst 2001; Rosario, Hearst, and Fillmore 2002).
---------------------------------------------------
J06-3003:4	184:729	Vanderwende (1994) used hand-built rules, together with a lexical knowledge base, to classify noun-modifier pairs.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-2064:5	15:163	Vanderwende (1994) attempted the automatic interpretation of NCs using hand-written rules, with the obvious cost of manual intervention.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-2064:6	68:163	Based on the pioneering work on Levi (1979) and Finin (1980), there have been efforts in computational linguistics to arrive at largely taskspecic sets of semantic relations, driven by the annotation of a representative sample of NCs from a given corpus type (Vanderwende, 1994; Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998; Rosario and Marti, 2001; Moldovan et al. , 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
J02-3004:7	491:554	Despite the differences among them, most approaches require large amounts of hand-crafted knowledge, place emphasis on the recovery of relations other than nominalizations (see the examples in (1)), contain no quantitative evaluation (the exceptions are Leonard (1984), Vanderwende (1994), and Lauer (1995)), and generally assume that context dependence is either negligible or of little impact.
---------------------------------------------------
J02-3004:8	501:554	Vanderwende (1994) further developed a rule-based algorithm that does not rely on a hand-crafted lexicon but extracts the required semantic information from an on-line dictionary instead.
---------------------------------------------------
J02-3004:9	47:554	With the exception of Wu (1993) and Lauer (1995), who use probabilistic models for compound noun interpretation (see Section 7 for details), most algorithms rely on hand-crafted knowledge bases or dictionaries that contain detailed semantic information for each noun; a sequence of rules exploit a knowledge base to choose the correct interpretation for a given compound (Finin 1980; McDonald 1982; Leonard 1984; Vanderwende 1994).
---------------------------------------------------
J06-1005:10	116:684	The best-performing noun compound interpretation systems have employed either symbolic (Finin 1980; Vanderwende 1994) or statistical techniques (Pustejovsky, Bergler, and Anick 1993; Lauer and Dras 1994; Lapata 2002) relying on rather ad hoc, domain-specific, hand-coded semantic taxonomies, or on statistical patterns in a large corpus of examples, respectively.
---------------------------------------------------
W07-2049:11	10:151	The proposed task is a generalisation of the more conventional task of interpreting noun compounds (NCs), inwhichwetakeaNCsuchas cookie jar and interpret it according to a pre-dened inventory of semantic relations (Levi, 1979; Vanderwende, 1994; BarkerandSzpakowicz, 1998).
---------------------------------------------------
J98-1003:12	144:551	The semantic relations and clusters have been shown to be very effective knowledge sources for such NLP tasks as WSD (McRoy 1992) and interpretation of noun sequences (Vanderwende 1994).
---------------------------------------------------
J98-1003:13	63:551	These relations are then used for various tasks, ranging from the interpretation of a noun sequence (Vanderwende 1994) or a prepositional phrase (Ravin 1990), to resolving structural ambiguity (Jenson and Binot 1987), to merging dictionary senses for WSD (Dolan 1994).
---------------------------------------------------
P02-1032:14	202:241	Vanderwende (1994) uses a sophisticated system to extract semantic information automatically from an on-line dictionary, and then manipulates a set of hand-written rules with handassigned weights to create an interpretation.
---------------------------------------------------
W04-2609:15	23:193	Other researchers have identified other sets of semantic relations (Levi 1979), (Vanderwende 1994), (Sowa 1994), (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998), (Rosario and Hearst 2001), (Kingsbury, et al. 2002), (Blaheta and Charniak 2000), (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002), (Gildea and Palmer 2002).
---------------------------------------------------
W04-2609:16	29:193	Many researchers that followed this approach relied mostly on hand-coded rules (Finin 1980), (Vanderwende 1994).

---------------------------------------------------
I08-1074:18	16:122	Recent attempts in the area of NC interpretation have taken two basic approaches: analogy-base interpretation (Rosario, 2001; Moldovan et al., 2004; Kim and Baldwin, 2005; Girju, 2007) and semantic disambiguation relative to an underlying predicate or semantically-unambiguous paraphrase (Vanderwende, 1994; Lapata, 2002; Kim and Baldwin, 2006; Nakov, 2006).

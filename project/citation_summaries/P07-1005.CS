This work extends several existing threads of research in statistical MT, including the use of context in example-based machine translation (Carl and Way, 2003) and the incorporation of word sense disambiguation into a translation model (Chan et al., 2007). 
1 Introduction It has long been believed that being able to detect the correct sense of a word in a given context  performing word sense disambiguation (WSD)  will lead to improved performance of systems tackling high end applications such as machine translation (Chan et al., 2007) and summarization(Elhadad et al., 1997). 
Carpuat and Wu (2007) and Chan et al. 
In Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), recent work shows that WSD helps translation quality when the WSD system directly uses translation candidates as sense inventories (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007; Gimenez and M`arquez, 2007). 
There has been considerable skepticism over whether WSD will actually improve performance of applications, but we are now starting to see improvement in performance due to WSD in cross-lingual information retrieval (Clough and Stevenson, 2004; Vossen et al., 2006) and machine translation (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007) and we hope that other applications such as question-answering, text simplication and summarisation might also benet as WSD methods improve.

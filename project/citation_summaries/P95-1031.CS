Researchers have explored this problem for a variety of reasons: to argue empirically against the poverty of the stimulus (Clark, 2001), to use induction systems as a first stage in constructing large treebanks (van Zaanen, 2000), or to build better language models (Baker, 1979; Chen, 1995). 
An important distinction should be drawn between work primarily interested in the weak generative capacity of models, where modeling hierarchical structure is only useful insofar as it leads to improved models over observed structures (Baker, 1979; Chen, 1995), and work interested in the strong generative capacity of models, where the unobserved structure itself is evaluated (van Zaanen, 2000; Clark, 2001; Klein and Manning, 2002). 
Researchers have explored this problem for a variety of reasons: to argue empirically against the poverty of the stimulus (Clark, 2001), to use induction systems as a first stage in constructing large treebanks (van Zaanen, 2000), to build better language models (Baker, 1979; Chen, 1995), and to examine cognitive issues in language learning (Solan et al. , 2003). 
Chen extracts rules by some heuristics and reestimates the probabilities of rules using the inside-outside algorithm (Chen, 1995). 
Among the theoretical and practical motivations to this problem are the study of human language acquisition (in particular, an empirical study of the poverty of stimulus hypothesis), preprocessing for constructing large treebanks (Van Zaanen, 2001), and improving language models (Chen, 1995).

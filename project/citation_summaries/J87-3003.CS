Many researchers have taken steps toward successful extraction of computationally useful lexical information from machine readable dictionaries and convert it into formal representation (Montemagnia and Vanderwende, 1993) (Byrd et al. , 1987) (Jensen and Binot, 1987).

Everyday dictionaries are obviously not structured in a way that enables their immediate use in NLP systems, but several Studies have shown that relatively simple procedures can be used to extract taxonomies and various other semantic relations (for example, Amsler, 1980; Calzolari, 1984; Cbodorow, Byrd, and Heidorn, 1985; Markowitz, Ahlswede, and Evens, 1986; Byrd et al. , 1987; Nakamura and Nagao, 1988; Vtronis and Ide, 1990~ Klavans, Chodorow, and Wacholder, 1990; Wilks et al. , 1990). 
Chodorow, et al.(1985) and Byrd, et al.(1987) discuss techniques for building dictionaries with the required scope by extracting lexical information from machinereadable versions of published dictionaries. 
INTRODUCTION There exists a substantial body of research demonstrating that machine readablc dictiotmries are a rich source of ready-made lexical and semantic information which can be used in natural language processing (for exantple, Amslcr, 1980; Calzolari, 1984; Markowitz, Ahlswede, and Evens, 1986; Byrd et al. , 1987; Nakamura and Nagao, 1988; V6ronis and Ide, 1990; Klavans, Chodorow, and Wachohler, 1990; Wilks et al. , 1990).

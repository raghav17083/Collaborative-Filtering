In previous studies there are some fruitful experiments on computationally processing temporal information in Chinese, e.g. Lee and Hsus Chinese to English machine translation     system (1990), Li, Wong, and Yuans temporal information-extraction system (2001), Xues machine learning system (2008), and Xue, Zhong & Chens tense annotation system (2008).

This problem of grammar size has been solved by Moore (2000) who developed a method, based on a left-corner grammar transformation, which produces non-left recursive grammars that are not much larger than the originals. 
Left-recursion elimination All direct and indirect left-recursion is removed using the LCLR transform described by Moore (2000). 
As Moore (2000) observes, in general the transforms produce a non-left-recursive output grammar only if tile input grammar G does not contain unary cycles, i.e., there is no nonterminal A such that A -~+ A. 2.1 The selective left-corner transform The selective left-corner transform takes as input a CFG G = (V, T, P, S) and a set of left-corner productions L C_ P, which contains no epsilon t)roductions; the non-left-corner prodnctions P L are called topdown productions. 
After this paI)er was accepted for publication we learnt of Moore (2000), which addresses the issue of grammar size using very similar techniques to those proposed here. 
Moore (2000) does not address left-corner tree-transforms, or questions of sparse data and parsing accuracy that are covered ill section 3.

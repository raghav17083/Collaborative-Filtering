3 Predictive Question-Answering First introduced in (Harabagiu et al. , 2005b), a predictive questioning approach to automatic 26 question-answering assumes that Q/A systems can use the set of documents relevant to a users query in order to generate sets of questions known as predictive questions that anticipate a users information needs. 
3 Recognizing Textual Entailment Recent work in computational semantics (Haghighi et al. , 2005; Hickl et al. , 2006b; MacCartney et al. , 2006) has demonstrated the viability of supervised machine learning-based approaches to the recognition of textual entailment (TE). 
(Jeon et al., 2005a; Jeon et al., 2005b) compared four different retrieval methods, i.e. vector space model, Okapi, language model (LM), and translation-based model, for automatically fixing the lexical chasm between questions of question search.

Figure 1: Three types of Contextual Entailment We believe the set of subquestions implied by QS can be used to test whether a text passage is relevant to S. Since the formal answerhood relation between a question and its answer(s) can be cast in terms of (logical) entailment (Groenendijk, 1999; Lewis, 1988), we believe that systems for recognizing textual entailment (Dagan et al. , 2005) could be used in order to identify those text passages that should be considered when gathering information related to a scenario.

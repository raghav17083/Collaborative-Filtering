Much of the recent work in word alignment has focussed on improving the word alignment quality through better modeling (Och and Ney, 2003; Deng and Byrne, 2005; Martin et al. , 2005) or alternative approaches to training (Fraser and Marcu, 2006b; Moore, 2005; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005).

Along similar lines, (Fraser and Marcu, 2006) combine a generative model of word alignment with a log-linear discriminative model trained on a small set of hand aligned sentences. 
Consequently, considerable effort has gone into devising and improving automatic word alignment algorithms, and into evaluating their performance (e.g., Och and Ney, 2003; Taskar et al., 2005; Moore et al., 2006; Fraser and Marcu, 2006, among many others). 
We ran the baseline semisupervised system for two iterations (line 2), and in contrast with (Fraser and Marcu, 2006b) we found that the best symmetrization heuristic for this system was union, which is most likely due to our use of fully linked alignments which was discussed at the end of Section 3.

However, the exact process of parameter setting has been studied only recently (e.g. Clark (1992), Gibson and Wexler (1994), Yang (1999), Briscoe (2000), among others) and although it has proved linguistically fruitful to construct parametric analyses, it turns out to be surprisingly difficult to construct a workable model of parameter-value acquisition.


In particular, it is instructive to introduce something like a class of null hypotheses: hybrid grammars which explicitly encode equality between any pair of competing alternatives ability to explain the data 5 .  5  The effect of mixed-grammar hypotheses can also be realized by allowing a selection procedure over a set of simple grammars, as described in Section 3.2, but, crucially, with the weights calculated under the assumption that data are generated by a combination of grammars (see, for example, the variational model proposed by Yang (1999), or the 6 I define this class as follows:  the posterior probability that the hypothesis NULL(i/j)   assigns to a stress class c is calculated by allotting equal probability to selecting the H i   or the H j   rule to produce an output of that class:  p(c|NULL(i/j)  ,y)=w i p(c|H i  ,y)+w j p(c|H j  ,y) (6) where w i = w j = .5.

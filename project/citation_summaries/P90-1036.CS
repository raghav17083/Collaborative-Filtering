2 Background In this section, we introduce a grammar conversion (Yoshinaga and Miyao, 2001) and CFG filtering (Harbusch, 1990; Poller and Becker, 1998; Torisawa et al. , 2000; Kiefer and Krieger, 2000). 
Various parsing algorithms for TAGs have been proposed in the literature: the worst-case time complexity varies from O(n 4 log n) (Harbusch, 1990) to O(n 6) (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985, Lang, 1990, Schabes, 1990) and O(n 9) (Schabes and Joshi, 1988). 
In this paper, we compare CFG filtering techniques for LTAG (Harbusch, 1990; Poller and Becker, 1998) and HPSG (Torisawa et al. , 2000; Kiefer and Krieger, 2000), following an approach to parsing comparison among different grammar formalisms (Yoshinaga et al. , 2001). 
6, Discussion Within the perspective of Lexicalized TAGs, known methods for TAGs recognition/parsing present some limitations: these methods behave in a left-to-right fashion (Schabes and Joshi, 1988) or they are purely bottom-up (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985, Harbusch, 1990), hence they cannot take advantage of anchor information in a direct way. 
2.2.1 CF approximation of LTAG In CFG filtering techniques for LTAG (Harbusch, 1990; Poller and Becker, 1998), every branching of elementary trees in a given grammar is extracted as a CFG rule as shown in Figure 1.

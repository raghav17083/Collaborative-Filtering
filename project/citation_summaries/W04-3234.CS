(2004) and Freitag (2004), uses distributional clustering to induce features from a large corpus, and then uses these features to augment the feature space of the labeled data. 
Named Entity Recognition can be viewed as an instance of the concept acquisition problem where the desired categories contain words that are names of entities of a particular kind, as done in (Freitag, 2004) using co-clustering and in (Etzioni et al., 2005) using predefined pattern types. 
(2004) and Freitag (2004) employ distributional and hierarchical clustering methods to improve the performance of NER within a single domain. 
Named Entity Recognition can be viewed as an instance of the concept acquisition problem where the desired concepts contain words that are names of entities of a particular kind, as done in (Freitag, 2004) using co-clustering and in (Etzioni et al., 2005) using predefined pattern types. 
In the form of transformation rules, it can help us classify unknown words, thereby enhancing the utility of cluster-based features for applications such as information extraction (Miller et al. , 2004; Freitag, 2004).

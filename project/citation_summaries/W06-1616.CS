Their performance depends on the dimensions and degree of sparsity of the constraint matrix A. Riedel and Clarke (2006) proposed an ILP formulation for dependency parsing which refines the arc-factored model by imposing linguistically motivated hard constraints that forbid some arc configurations. 
Recently there have also been proposals for exhaustive methods that weaken the edge-factored assumption, including both approximate methods (McDonaldandPereira, 2006)andexactmethodsthroughinteger linear programming (Riedel and Clarke, 2006) or branch-and-bound algorithms (Hirakawa, 2006).

(2008), which attempts to approximate non-local features.13 We did not reproduce the model of Riedel and Clarke (2006) since the latter is tailored for labeled dependency parsing; however, experiments reported in that paper for Dutch (and extended to other languages in the CoNLL-X task) suggest that their model performs worse than our three baselines. 
In contrast, generic NP-hard solution techniques like Integer Linear Programming (Riedel and Clarke, 2006) know nothing about optimal substructure.

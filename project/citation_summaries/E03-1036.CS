Baldridge and Kruijff (2003) described how the remaining language specific grammatical constraints described by Steedman (2000) could be controlled in the lexicon, using multi-modal slashes that have since become integrated into the main body of the theory (Steedman and Baldridge, 2007). 
The rules of this multimodal version of CCG (Baldridge, 2002; Baldridge and Kruijff, 2003) are derived as theorems of a Categorial Type Logic (CTL, Moortgat (1997)). 
MMCCG is a lexicalist grammar formalism in which application of combinatory rules is controlled though context-sensitive specification of modes on slashes (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2003). 
2 Background 2.1 Surface Realization with OpenCCG The OpenCCG surface realizer is based on Steedmans (2000) version of CCG elaborated with Baldridge and Kruijffs multi-modal extensions for lexically specified derivation control (Baldridge, 2002; Baldridge and Kruijff, 2003) and hybrid logic dependency semantics (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2002). 
This would mean that the ability of CCG to generate noncontext-free languages (also linguistically relevant ones) hinges crucially on its ability to restrict the allowable instances of rule schemata, for instance, using slash types (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2003).

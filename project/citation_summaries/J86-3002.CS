While there has been prior research on identifying the primary lexical patterns of a sub-language or corpus (Grishman et al. , 1986; Riloff, 1996), the task here is more complex, since we are typically not provided in advance with a sub-corpus of relevant passages; these passages must themselves be found as part of the discovery process. 
Grishman et al (1986)). 
Traditionally such semantic knowledge is handcrafted, though some software aids exist to enable greater productivity (Ayuso et al. , 1987; Bates, 1989; Grishman et al. , 1986; Weischedel, et al. , 1989). 
Statistical data about these various cooccurrence relations is employed for a variety of applications, such as speech recognition (Jelinek, 1990), language generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990), lexicography (Church and Hanks, 1990), machine translation (Brown et al. , ; Sadler, 1989), information retrieval (Maarek and Smadja, 1989) and various disambiguation tasks (Dagan et al. , 1991; Hindle and Rooth, 1991; Grishman et al. , 1986; Dagan and Itai, 1990). 
As wa.s noted in \[Grishman et al. 1986\], the cooccurrence patterns reflect regularized or canonical structure.

Such a fusion of structural and iexical preference strategies is suggested in \[Whittemore et al. , 1990\], and \[Weischedel et aL, 1989\] 63 have found that a structural strategy ("closest attachment") performs well in combination with a class-based strategy, although they use a relatively small, domainspecific taxonomy of classes and assume each word has a pointer to a unique class. 
A recent study of attachment of prepositional phrases in a sample of written responses to a "Wizard of Oz" travel information experiment shows that niether Right Association nor Minimal Attachment account for more than 55% of the cases (Whittemore et al. 1990). 
While there are also other principles proposed in the literature, including the Minimal Attachment Principle (Frazier and Fodor, 1979), they are generally either not highly functional or are covered by the above three principles in any case (Hobbs and Bear, 1990; Whittemore et al. , 1990). 
According to Whittemore et al. and Hobbs & Bear, nearly all of the ambiguities can be resolved by first applying LPR and then RAP and ALPP (Hobbs and Bear, 1990; Whittemore et al. , 1990).

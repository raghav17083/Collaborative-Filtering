Clark and Curran (2007) describe a perceptronbased approach for CCG parsing which is considerably more efficient, and makes use of a supertagging model to prune the search space of the full parsing model. 
We have also investigated perceptron training for the parser (Clark and Curran, 2007b), obtaining comparable accuracy scores and similar training times (a few hours) compared with the log-linear models. 
Second, we include syntactic features in our 414 Feature Type Example LexCat + Word s/s/np + before LexCat + POS s/s/np + IN Rule sdcl  np sdcl\np Rule + Word sdcl  np sdcl\np + bought Rule + POS sdcl  np sdcl\np + VBD Word-Word company, sdcl  np sdcl\np, bought Word-POS company, sdcl  np sdcl\np, VBD POS-Word NN, sdcl  np sdcl\np, bought Word + w bought, sdcl  np sdcl\np + dw POS + w VBD, sdcl  np sdcl\np + dw Word + p bought, sdcl  np sdcl\np + dp POS + p VBD, sdcl  np sdcl\np + dp Word + v bought, sdcl  np sdcl\np + dv POS + v VBD, sdcl  np sdcl\np + dv Table 1: Basic and dependency features from Clark & Currans (2007b) normal form model; distances are in intervening words, punctuation marks and verbs, and are capped at 3, 3 and 2, respectively model by implementing Clark & Currans (2007b) normal form model in OpenCCG.4 The features of this model are listed in Table 1; they are integervalued, representing counts of occurrences in a derivation. 
Averaged perceptron models are very simple, just requiring a decoder and a simple update function, yet despite their simplicity they have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in Treebank and CCG parsing (Huang, 2008; Clark and Curran, 2007a) as well as on other NLP tasks. 
However, following Clark & Curran (2007a), during training we seed the realizer with the gold-standard supertags, augmenting the hypertaggers -best list, in order to ensure that the n-best realizations are generally of high quality; consequently, the gold standard realization (i.e., the corpus sentence) usually appears in the n-best list.3 In addition, we use a hypertagger trained on all the training data, to improve hypertaggerperformance,whileexcludingthecur3AsinClark&Curransapproach,weuseasingle value during training, rather than iteratively loosening the  value; the chosen  value determines the size of the discrimation space.

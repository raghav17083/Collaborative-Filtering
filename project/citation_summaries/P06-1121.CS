2 Tree-based Translation We review in this section the tree-based approach to machine translation (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), and its rule extraction algorithm (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006). 
Based on these grammars, a great number of SMT models have been recently proposed, including string-to-string model (Synchronous FSG) (Brown et al., 1993; Koehn et al., 2003), tree-to-string model (TSG-string) (Huang et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007), string-totree model (string-CFG/TSG) (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006), tree-to-tree model (Synchronous CFG/TSG, Data-Oriented Translation) (Chiang, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Zhang et al., 2007; Bod, 2007; Quirk wt al., 2005; Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003) and so on. 
5.2 Tree-to-string Decoding In tree-to-string (also called syntax-directed) decoding (Huang et al. , 2006; Liu et al. , 2006), the source string is first parsed into a tree, which is then recursively converted into a target string according to transfer rules in a synchronous grammar (Galley et al. , 2006). 
(2006) string-to-tree Galley et al. 
Another interesting direction is applying our approach to extracting translation rules with hierarchical structures such as hierarchical phrases (Chiang, 2007) and tree-to-string rules (Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006).

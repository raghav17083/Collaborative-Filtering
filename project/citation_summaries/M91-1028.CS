(Grishman et al. , 1991; Hobbs, 1978; Tomita, 1985) and semantic-centered approaches (Riesbeck and Martin, 1986; Cardie and Lehnert, 1991; Slator and Wilks, 1991).


In approaching the problem of unrestricted texts, we agree with those researchers (Hobbs, 1991; Grishman et al. , 1991) who think that it is possible to build correct parses and interpretations for realworld texts.

1.2 Related Work There is a growing body of work on the use of syntax for improving statistical machine translation, from approaches such as (Chiang, 2007) that use formal syntax, that is syntactic structures for the source and target that are discovered on the basis of a bilingual corpus, but without resort to an externally motivated parser, to approaches such as (Yamada and Knight, 2001) and (Marcu et al., 2006) that use an external parser on the target only, or such as (Quirk et al., 2005) on the source only, or such as (Cowan et al., 2006) that use external parsers both on the source and on the target. 
Based on these grammars, a great number of SMT models have been recently proposed, including string-to-string model (Synchronous FSG) (Brown et al., 1993; Koehn et al., 2003), tree-to-string model (TSG-string) (Huang et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007), string-totree model (string-CFG/TSG) (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006), tree-to-tree model (Synchronous CFG/TSG, Data-Oriented Translation) (Chiang, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Zhang et al., 2007; Bod, 2007; Quirk wt al., 2005; Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003) and so on. 
The BOW approach is different from the parsing based approaches (Melamed, 2004; Zhang and Gildea, 2005; Cowan et al. , 2006) where the translation model tightly couples the syntactic and lexical items of the two languages. 
They can be roughly divided into three categories: string-to-tree models (e.g., (Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008)), tree-to-string models (e.g., (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006)), and tree-totree models (e.g., (Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008)). 
1 Introduction Phrase-based method (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2007) and syntaxbased method (Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Eisner, 2003; Chiang, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007c, 2008a, 2008b; Shen et al., 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008) represent the state-of-the-art technologies in statistical machine translation (SMT).

We use the averaged perceptron algorithm, as presented in Collins (2002), to train the parser. 
This model is related to the averaged perceptron algorithm of Collins (2002). 
To train the model, we use the averaged perceptron algorithm described by Collins (2002). 
3 The Perceptron The perceptron algorithm introduced into NLP by Collins (2002), is a simple but effective discriminative training method. 
2.3 The Averaged Perceptron Reranking Model Averaged perceptron (Collins, 2002a) has been successfully applied to several tagging and parsing reranking tasks (Collins, 2002c; Collins, 2002a), and in this paper, we employed it in reranking semantic parses generated by the base semantic parser SCISSOR.

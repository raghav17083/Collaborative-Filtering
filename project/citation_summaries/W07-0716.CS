3.1 Paraphrasing by pivot translation Whereas attempts at using two translation systems in pivot have met with some success for lowresourced language pairs, it is unlikely that current SMT systems can be successfully called in succession to obtain high-quality sentential paraphrases.5 Several works have shown that monolingual biphrases obtained by multilingual pivots can be used by decoders, but although gains can for example be obtained by using sentential paraphrases as alternative reference corpora for optimizing SMT systems (Madnani et al., 2007), resulting paraphrases seem to be of too low quality 4Current approaches based on paraphrase patterns are only a partial solution to this issue, as the variables used are limited to simple types.


(Zhao et al., 2008a) acquired monolingual biphrases from various sources and used them with a phrase-based SMT decoder, and (Madnani et al., 2007) combined rules of their hierarchical decoders by pivot to obtain a monolingual grammar. These works were not motivated by the generation of high-quality paraphrases that could, for example, be reused in documents.


Recent work has proposed augmenting the training data with paraphrases generated by pivoting through other languages (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Madnani et al., 2007).


Another approach using a pivoting technique augments the human reference translation with paraphrases, creating additional translation references (Madnani et al., 2007).

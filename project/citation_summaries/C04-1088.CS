321 Although there are many types of stylistic features suggested in the literature, we make use of the ones that are readily computable and countable from SMS message texts without any complex linguistic analysis as a preliminary step, including word and sentence lengths (Mendenhall, 1887), frequencies of function words (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964), and part-of-speech tags and tag ngrams (Argamon-Engelson et al., 1998; Koppel et al., 2003; Santini, 2004). 
In (Clement and Sharp, 2003; Gamon, 2004; Peng et al. , 2004), the attribution of a given document was forced to one of the authors from a set of possible authors (i.e. a closed set identification setup), thus not taking into account the realistic case of having a document which was not 482 written by any of the authors. 
Deep linguistic analysis-based stylistic features, such as context free grammar production frequencies (Gamon, 2004) and syntactic rewrite rules in an automatic parse (Baayen et al., 1996), that have already been successfully used in the stylometry literature may be considered. 
Specifically, in (Corney, 2003) the largest dataset contains texts from five authors, in (Gamon, 2004) from three, while in (Peng et al. , 2004) and (Koppel and Schler, 2004) from ten. 
Gamon (2004) utilised SVMs with syntactic and semantic features to obtain relatively minor accuracy improvements over the use of function word frequencies and part-of-speech trigrams.

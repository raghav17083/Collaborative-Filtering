There is a vast literature on spelling correction (Jones and Martin, 1997; Golding and Roth, 1996) using both linguistic and statistical approaches. 
The more recent set of techniques includes mult iplicative weightupdate algorithms (Golding and Roth, 1998), latent semantic analysis (Jones and Martin, 1997), transformation-based learning (Mangu and Brill, 1997), differential grammars (Powers, 1997), decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994), and a variety of Bayesian classifiers (Gale et al. , 1993, Golding, 1995, Golding and Schabes, 1996). 
1 Introduction Vector-based models of word co-occurrence have proved a useful representational framework for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as word sense discrimination (Schtze, 1998), text segmentation (Choi et al. , 2001), contextual spelling correction (Jones and Martin, 1997), automatic thesaurus extraction (Grefenstette, 1994), and notably information retrieval (Salton et al. , 1975). 
These include a variety of Bayesian classifiers (Golding, 1995; Golding and Schabes, 1996), decision lists (Golding, 1995) transformation-based learning (Mangu and Brill, 1997), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Jones and Martin, 1997), multiplicative weight update algorithms (Golding and Roth, 1999), and augmented mixture models (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 2002).

While there has been a spurt of recent research addressing the event ordering problem, e.g., (Mani and Wilson 2000) (Filatova and Hovy 2001) (Schilder and Habel 2001) (Li et al. 2001) (Mani et al. 2003) (Li et al. 2004) (Lapata and Lascarides 2004) (Boguraev and Ando 2005) (Mani et al. 2006), that research relies on qualitative temporal relations. 
In a similar vein, Lapata and Lascarides (2004) used pairings of only verbs, nouns and adjectives for predicting which temporal connective is most suitable to express the relation between two given text spans. 
Finally, (Lapata and Lascarides 2004) use found data to successfully learn which (possibly ambiguous) temporal markers connect a main and subordinate clause, without inferring underlying temporal relations. 
qualifies the denoted event with modal information (irrealis, necessity, possibility), and therefore has implications for the suitability of statements as answers to questions, in a parallel way to other intensional contexts exemplified in (1-2); AF Tense and aspect provide crucial information for the temporal ordering of the events; AF Similarly, the non-finite morphology of certain verbal expressions (infinitival, present participle, or past participle) has been shown as useful in predicting temporal relations between events (Lapata and Lascarides, 2004). 
Indeed, word pairs form the basic feature of most previous work on classifying implicit relations (Marcu and Echihabi, 2001; BlairGoldensohn et al., 2007; Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008) or the simpler task of predicting which connective should be used to express a relation (Lapata and Lascarides, 2004).

2 Models Recent studies into the use of supervised learningbased modeels for the NE task in the molecularbiology domain have shown that models based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) (Collier et al. , 2000) and decision trees (Nobata et al. , 1999) are not only adaptable to this highly technical domain, but are also much more generalizable to new classes of words than systems based on traditional hand-built heuristic rules such as (Fukuda et al. , 1998). 
Previous approaches on biological named entity extraction can be classified into two types  rule based (Fukuda et al. , 1998; Olsson et al. , 2002; Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002) and corpus-based (Collier et al. , 2000; Chang et al. , 2004). 
In the biomedical domain, NER has focused on identification of biological entities such as genes and proteins (Collier et al. , 2000; Yu et al. , 2002). 
This kind of features have been widely used in both newswire NER system, such as (Zhou and Su 2002), and biomedical NER system, such as (Nobata et al. 1999; Gaizauskas et al. 2000; Collier et al. 2000; Takeuchi and Collier 2002; Kazama et al. 2002). 
Previous approaches on biological named entities extraction can be classified into two types  say, rule-based (Fukuda, et al. , 1998; Humphreys, et al. , 2000; Olsson, et al. , 2002) and corpus-based (Collier, et al. , 2000).

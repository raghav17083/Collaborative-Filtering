This gives rise to a notion of regular dependency languages, and allows us to establish a formal relation between the structural constraints and mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms (Joshi, 1985): We show that regular dependency languages correspond to the sets of derivations of lexicalized Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (lcfrs) (Vijay-Shanker et al. , 1987), and that the gap-degree measure is the structural correspondent of the concept of fan-out in this formalism (Satta, 1992). 
1.2 Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems A linear context-free rewriting system (LCFRS; VijayShanker et al. , 1987) is a linear, non-erasing multiple context-free grammar (MCFG; Seki et al. , 1991). 
The most remarkable attempts in such a direction are found in \[VijayShanker et al. , 1987\] and \[Weir, 1988\] with the introduction of linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRS) and in \[Kasami et al. , 1987\] and \[Seki et a/. 
We write REGD.k/ to refer to the class of regular dependency languages with a gap-degree bounded by k. LinearContext-FreeRewritingSystems Gap-restricted dependency languages are closely related to Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (lcfrs) (Vijay-Shanker et al. , 1987), a class of formal systems that generalizes several mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms. 
They are in particular more powerful than linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRS) (Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987).

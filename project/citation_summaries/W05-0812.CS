Lopez and Resnik (2005) extended the HMM model by integrating a tree distortion model based on a dependency parser built on the English side of the parallel corpus. 
Given numerous (constructive) debates held during the previous word alignment evaluation, which questioned the informativeness of the NULL alignment evaluations, we decided 67 Team System name Description Carnegie Mellon University SPA (Brown et al. , 2005) Information Sciences Institute / USC ISI (Fraser and Marcu, 2005) Johns Hopkins University JHU (Schafer and Drabek, 2005) Microsoft Research MSR (Moore, 2005) Romanian Academy Institute of Artificial Intelligence TREQ-AL, MEBA, COWAL (Tufis et al. , 2005) University of Maryland / UMIACS UMIACS (Lopez and Resnik, 2005) University of Sheffield Sheffield (Aswani and Gaizauskas, 2005a) University of Montreal JAPA, NUKTI (Langlais et al. , 2005) University of Sao Paulo, University of Alicante LIHLA (Caseli et al. , 2005) University Jaume I MAR (Vilar, 2005) Table 1: Teams participating in the word alignment shared task to evaluate only no-NULL alignments, and thus the NULL alignments were removed from both submissions and gold standard data. 
The experiments performed included Model 4 and the HMM extensions of (Lopez and Resnik, 2005). 
However, few of these methods have explicitly addressed the tension between word alignments and the syntactic processes that employ them (Cherry and Lin, 2006; Daume III and Marcu, 2005; Lopez and Resnik, 2005). 
Deeper syntax, e.g. phrase or dependency structures, has been shown useful in generative models (Wang and Zhou, 2004; Lopez and Resnik, 2005), heuristic-based models (Ayan et al., 2004; Ozdowska, 2004) and even for syntactically motivated models such as ITG (Wu, 1997; Cherry and Lin, 2006).

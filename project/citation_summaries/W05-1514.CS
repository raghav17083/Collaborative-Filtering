This work has led to the development of deterministic parsers for constituent structures as well (Sagae and Lavie, 2005; Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005). 
One such approach is maximum entropy classification (Berger et al. , 1996), which we use in the form of a library implemented by Tsuruoka1 and used in his classifier-based parser (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005).

We used the chunk parser developed by Tsuruoka and Tsujii (2005a). 
We first applied beam thresholding techniques developed for CFG parsing to HPSG parsing, including local thresholding, global thresholding (Goodman, 1997), and iterative parsing (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005b).

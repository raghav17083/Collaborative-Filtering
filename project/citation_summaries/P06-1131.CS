This finding is in accordance with Kelleher and Kruijffs (2006) approach of preferring topological spatial relations over projective ones. 
Furthermore, the Dale and Haddock algorithm and most of its successors (such as (Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006)) are vulnerable to the problem of infinite regress, where the algorithm jumps back and forth between generating descriptions for two related individuals infinitely, as in the book on the table which supports a book on the table . . . 
For example, spatial descriptions have been studied from the perspective of robot communication (Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006), 3D animation (Towns et al., 1998) and basic visual scenes (Viethen and Dale, 2008; Ebert et al., 1996). 
While Dale and Haddocks algorithm attempts to generate a RE for a single individual, for successive individuals in the model, our algorithms consider all individuals in GRE algorithm DL variant Dale and Reiter (1995) CL van Deemter (2002) PL Dale and Haddock (1991) EL Kelleher and Kruijff (2006) EL Gardent (2002) ELU(:) Figure 5: DL variants used by different GRE algorithms. 
Recently, Kelleher and Kruijff (2006) have presented an incremental GRE algorithm for situated dialogue with a robot about a table-top setting, i.e. alsoabout small-scale space.

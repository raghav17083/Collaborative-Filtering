(Wu and Zhou, 2003) also make full use of large scale monolingual corpora and limited bilingual corpora for synonymous collocation extraction. 
Similarly, Hua Wu (Wu and Zhou 2003) applied synonyms relationship between two different languages to automatically acquire English synonymous collocation. 
(Wu and Zhou, 2003) just extract the synonymy collocation, such as <turn on, OBJ, light> and <switch on, OBJ, light> using both monolingual corpora and bilingual corpora to get an optimal result, but do not generalize them. 
Besides, Wu and Zhou (2003) exploited bilingual corpora and translation information in learning synonymous collocations. 
We use the cosine similarity measure for windowbased contexts and the following commonly used similarity measures for the syntactic vector space: Hindles (1990) measure, the weighted Lin measure (Wu and Zhou, 2003), the -Skew divergence measure (Lee, 1999), the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence measure (Lin, 1991), Jaccards coef cient (van Rijsbergen, 1979) and the Confusion probability (Essen and Steinbiss, 1992).

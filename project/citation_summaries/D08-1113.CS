Indicator Features Previous approaches to discriminative character transduction tend to employ only sparse indicators (Jiampojamarn et al., 2008; Dreyer et al., 2008). 
In machine learning work on lemmatization for highly inflective languages, it is most often assumed that a word form and a POS tag are given, and the task is to predict the set of corresponding lemma(s) (Mooney and Califf, 1995; Clark, 2002; Wicentowski, 2002; Erjavec and Dzeroski, 2004; Dreyer et al., 2008). 
We demonstrate that despite recent successes in discriminative character transduction using indicator features (Jiampojamarn et al., 2008; Dreyer et al., 2008), our generative hybrid performs surprisingly well, producing our highest transliteration accuracies. 
Our task setting differs from most work on lemmatization which uses either no or a complete rootlist (Wicentowski, 2002; Dreyer et al., 2008).2 We can use all forms occurring in the unlabeled text T but there are no guarantees about the coverage of the target lemmas or the number of noise words which may occur in T (see Table 2 for data statistics). 
Researchers frequently compare against a phrasal SMT baseline when evaluating a new transduction technique (Freitag and Khadivi, 2007; Dreyer et al., 2008); however, we are careful to vary only the features in our comparison.

Recently several latent variable models for constituent parsing have been proposed (Koo and Collins, 2005; Matsuzaki et al. , 2005; Prescher, 2005; Riezler et al. , 2002). 
Compared to a basic treebank grammar (Charniak, 1996), the grammars of highaccuracy parsers weaken independence assumptions by splitting grammar symbols and rules with either lexical (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 1999) or nonlexical (Klein and Manning, 2003; Matsuzaki et al. , 2005) conditioning information. 
For example, incremental CFG parsing algorithms can be used with the CFGs produced by this transform, as can the Inside-Outside estimation algorithm (Lari and Young, 1990) and more exotic methods such as estimating adjoined hidden states (Matsuzaki et al. , 2005; Petrov et al. , 2006). 
5 Related Work There has not been much previous work on graphical models for full parsing, although recently several latent variable models for parsing have been proposed (Koo and Collins, 2005; Matsuzaki et al. , 2005; Riezler et al. , 2002). 
Rather than explicit annotation, we could use latent annotations to split the POS tags, similarly to the introduction of latent annotations to PCFG grammars (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).

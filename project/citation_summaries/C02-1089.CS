Since the size of problem space for syllable-to-word (STW) conversion is much less than that of syllable-tocharacter (STC) conversion, the most existing Chinese input systems (Hsu 1994, Hsu et al. 1999, Tsai and Hsu 2002, Gao et al. 2002, MSIME) are addressed on STW conversion. 
Conventionally, there are two approaches for STW conversion: (1) the linguistic approach based on syntax parsing, semantic template matching and contextual information (Hsu 1994, Fu et al. 1996, Hsu et al. 1999, Kuo 1995, Tsai and Hsu 2002); and (2) the statistical approach based on the n-gram models where n is usually 2 or 3 (Lin and Tsai 1987, Gu et al. 1991, Fu et al. 1996, Ho et al. 1997, Sproat 1990, Gao et al. 2002, Lee 2003). 
The UDN2001 corpus is a collection of 4,539624 Chinese sentences extracted from whole 2001 UDN (United Daily News, 2001) Website in Taiwan (Tsai and Hsu, 2002). 
Since the size of problem space for syllable-to-word (STW) conversion is much less than that of syllable-tocharacter (STC) conversion, the most pinyinbased Chinese input systems (Hsu, 1994; Hsu et al. , 1999; Tsai and Hsu, 2002; Gao et al. , 2002; Microsoft Research Center in Beijing; Tsai, 2005) are addressed on STW conversion. 
Conventionally, there are two approaches for syllable-to-word (STW) conversion: (1) the linguistic approach based on syntax parsing, se9 mantic template matching and contextual information (Hsu 1994, Fu et al. 1996, Hsu et al. 1999, Kuo 1995, Tsai and Hsu 2002); and (2) the statistical approach based on the n-gram models where n is usually 2 or 3 (Lin and Tsai 1987, Gu et al. 1991, Fu et al. 1996, Ho et al. 1997, Sproat 1990, Gao et al. 2002, Lee 2003).

Conceptual Density Agirre and Rigau:s (1996) approach has a ~imilar motivation as Kesnik's. 
This task is closely related to both named entity recognition (NER), which traditionally assigns nouns to a small number of categories and word sense disambiguation (Agirre and 1http://class.inrialpes.fr/ Rigau, 1996; Yarowsky, 1995), where the sense for a word is chosen from a much larger inventory of word senses. 
A method not evaluated by (Patwardhan et al. , 2003) and using another semantic relatedness measure ("conceptual density") is (Agirre and Rigau, 1996). 
The use of semantic neighbors and class-labelling for computing with meaning go far beyond the experimental set up for lexical acquisition described in this paper  for example, Resnik (1999) used the idea of a most informative subsuming node (which can be regarded as a kind of class-label) for disambiguation, as did Agirre and Rigau (1996) with the conceptual density algorithm. 
Works on word similarity and word sense disambiguation are generally based on statistical methods designed for large or even very large corpora (Hindle, 1.990; Agirre and Rigau, 1996).

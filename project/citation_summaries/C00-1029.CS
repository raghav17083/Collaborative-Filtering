One approach (Resnik 1993; Li and Abe 1998; Clark and Weir 2000) is to induce probability distributions over semantic classes rather than lexical items. 
An evaluation using a PP attachment task was attempted in Clark and Weir (2000), but the evaluation was limited by the relatively small size of the Penn Treebank. 
Alternative approaches are described in Clark and Weir (1999) (see also Clark [2001]), Abney and Light (1999), and Ciaramita and Johnson (2000). 
The ambiguity can be resolved by noting that the correct sense of spoon is more likely to be an argument of ate-with than strawberries-with (Li and Abe 1998; Clark and Weir 2000). 
5.2 Pseudo-Disambiguation Task Pseudo-disambiguation tasks have become a standard evaluation technique (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Sch utze 1992; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Sch utze 1998; Lee 1999; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999; Golding and Roth 1999; Rooth et al. 1999; EvenZohar and Roth 2000; Lee 2001; Clark and Weir 2002) and, in the current setting, we may use a nouns neighbors to decide which of two co-occurrences is the most likely.

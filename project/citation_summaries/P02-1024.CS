Among various language modeling approaches, ngram modeling has been widely used in many applications, such as speech recognition, machine translation (Katz 1987; Jelinek 1989; Gale and Church 1990; Brown et al. 1992; Yang et al. 1996; Bai et al 1998; Zhou et al 1999; Rosenfeld 2000; Gao et al 2002).


More recently, a method for clustering words at different positions was developed (Yamamoto et al. , 2001; Gao et al. , 2002).

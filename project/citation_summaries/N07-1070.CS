4 Testing the Four Hypotheses The question of why self-training helps in some cases (McClosky et al., 2006; Reichart and Rappoport, 2007) but not others (Charniak, 1997; Steedman et al., 2003) has inspired various theories. 
A dependency parser based on this syntax was used in the best-performing system in the SemEval-2007 task on Frame-semantic Structure Extraction (Baker et al., 2007), and the conversion method (in two different forms) was used for the English data in the CoNLL Shared Tasks of 2007 and 2008. 
These annotations can be used by various higher-level applications such as semantic role labeling (Pradhan et al., 2007) and machine translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001). 
Out-of-domain Test Sets We finally conducted an evaluation of the semantic role classification accuracies on an out-ofdomain test set: the FrameNet-annotated Nuclear Threat Initiative texts from SemEval task (Baker et al., 2007). 
Comparatively, the best English SRL results reported drops from 91.2 (Pradhan et al., 2008) to 80.56 (Surdeanu et al., 2007).

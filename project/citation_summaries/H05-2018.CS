As an alternative other teams during the last TREC and NTCIR evaluation campaigns have suggested variations of Nave Bayes classifier, language models and SVM, along with the use of such heuristics as word order, punctuation, sentence length, etc. We might also mention OpinionFinder (Wilson et al., 2005), a more complex system that performs subjectivity analyses to identify opinions as well as sentiments and other private states (speculations, dreams, etc.). 
Another area related to our work is opinion expressions identification (Wilson et al., 2005a; Breck et al., 2007). 
2) English lexicons Positive_Dic en : 2718 English positive terms were collected from the feature file subjclueslen1HLTEMNLP05.tff 8  containing the subjectivity clues used in the work (Wilson et al., 2005a; Wilson et al., 2005b). 
The classifier in this section is an implementation of the neutral/polar supervised classifier of (Wilson et al., 2005a) (using the same features), except that the classes are S/O rather than neutral/polar. 
First, we show that subjectivity sense ambiguity is highly prevalent in the MPQA opinion-annotated corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005; Wilson, 2008), thus establishing the potential benefit of performing SWSD.

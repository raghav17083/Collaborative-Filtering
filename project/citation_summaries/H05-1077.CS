Aitchinson (2003) and Schulte im Walde and Melinger (2005) show that such associations can be motivated by a number of factors, from semantic similarity to collocation. 
In psycholinguistics, relatedness of words can also be determined through association tests (Schulte im Walde and Melinger, 2005). 
Interestingly, in computational linguistics and psycholinguisticsthereisanadditionalstrandofresearchinvestigatingtheso-called association relation,e.g. Schulte im Walde and Melinger(2005)and Roth and Schulte im Walde (2008), which is not yet considered or integrated in the research on semantic relatedness measures. 
b) Co-occurrence window: In previous work (Schulte im Walde and Melinger, 2005), we showed that only 28% of all noun associates were identied by the above statistical grammar as subcategorised nouns, but 69% were captured by a 20-word co-occurrence window in a 200-million word newspaper corpus. 
The association-based class semantics is similar to FrameNet, because the associations are unrestricted in their semantic relation to the experiment verb (Schulte im Walde and Melinger, 2005).

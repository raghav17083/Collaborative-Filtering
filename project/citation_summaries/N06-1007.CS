(Pekar, 2006) learns rules only between templates related by local discourse (information from different documents is ignored). 
Another way of using argument information is proposed by Pekar (2006), which identifies candidate verb pairs for the entailment relation by imposing criteria: (a) the two verbs must appear in the same local discourse-related context and (b) their arguments need to refer to the same participant, i.e. anchor. 
Motivated by this background, several research groups have reported their experiments on automatic acquisition of causal, temporal and entailment relations between event mentions (typically verbs or verb phrases) (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Inui et al., 2003; Chklovski and Pantel, 2005; Torisawa, 2006; Pekar, 2006; Zanzotto et al., 2006, etc.). 
With 850 Precision(l,r) we obtain a soft version of the inclusion hypothesis presented in (Geffet and Dagan, 2005), which expects l to entail r if the important features of l appear also in r. Similarly, the LEDIR algorithm (Bhagat et al., 2007) identifies the entailment direction between two binary templates, l and r, which participate in a relation learned by (the symmetric) DIRT, by measuring the proportion of instantiations of l that are covered by the instantiations of r. As far as we know, only (Shinyama et al., 2002) and (Pekar, 2006) learn rules between unary templates. 
3.3.1 Instance-based anchors Inspired by Pekar (2006)s way of using anchors for verb entailment acquisition, we assume that if two related predicates have a shared argument, they must tend to appear in the same local discourse-related context with the shared argument filled with the same noun phrase (i.e. anchor).

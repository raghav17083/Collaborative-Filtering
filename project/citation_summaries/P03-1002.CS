Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) presented a compact set of features across these three types, which has served as the core of most of the subsequent SRL work: (1) the phrase type, headword, and governing category of the constituent; (2) the lemma, voice, and subcategorization pattern of the verb; and (3) the left/right position of the constituent with respect to the verb, and the category path between them.Extensions to these features have been proposed in various directions.Exploiting the ability of some machine learning algorithms to work with very large feature spaces, some authors have largely extended the representation of the constituent and its context, including among others: rst and last words (and part-of-speech) in the constituent, bag-of-words, n-grams of part of speech, and sequence of top syntactic elements in the constituent.Parent and sibling constituents in the tree may also be codied with all the previous structural and lexical features (Pradhan et al.2005a; Surdeanu et al.2007).Other authors have designed new features with specic linguistic motivations.For instance, Surdeanu et al.(2003) generalized the concept of headword with the content word feature.They also used named entity labels as features.Xue and Palmer (2004) presented the syntactic frame feature, which captures the overall sentence structure using the verb predicate and the constituent as pivots.All these features resulted in a signicant increase in performance. 
It has obvious applications for template-filling tasks such as information extraction and question answering (Surdeanu et al., 2003; Moschitti et al., 2003). 
The PropBank annotations (www.cis.upenn.edu/ ace) enable training for two distinct learning techniques: (1) decision trees (Surdeanu et al. , 2003) and (2) Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Pradhan et al. , 2004). 
Recent corpus-based approaches to identify semantic roles (Roth et al 2002, Gildea and Jurafsky 2002; Gildea and Palmer 2002; Surdeanu et al. , 2003) have been successful in identifying domain independent semantic relations with respect to the predicate-argument structure. 
The characteristics of x are: frame, frame evoking word, head word, content word (Surdeanu et al., 2003), first/last word, head word of left/right sister, phrase type, position, voice, syntactic path (directed/undirected/partial), governing category (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), WordNet supersense in the phrase, combination features of frame evoking word & headword, combination features of frame evoking word & phrase type, and combination features of voice & phrase type.

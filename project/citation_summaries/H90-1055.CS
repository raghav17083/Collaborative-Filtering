This can be done by smoothing the observed frequencies 7 (Church and Mercer 1993) or by class-based methods (Brown et al. 1991; Pereira and Tishby 1992; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Hirschman 1986; Resnik 1992; Brill et al. 1990; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993). 
2 Training Corpus The experiments use texts from the Wall Street Journ~d Corpus,and its partially bracketed version provided by the Penn Treebank (Brill et al. , 1990). 
Several kinds of POS taggers using rule-based (e.g., Brill et al., 1990), statistical (e.g., Merialdo, 1994), memory-based (e.g., Daelemans, 1996), and neural network (e.g., Schmid, 1994) models have been proposed for some languages. 
This can be done by smoothing the observed frequencies (Church and Mercer, 1993), or by class-based methods (Brown et al. , 1991; Pereira and Tishby, 1992; Pereira et ah, 1993; Hirschman, 1986; Resnik, 1992; Brill et ah, 1990; Dagan et al. , 1993). 
The second experiment uses a naturally occurring corpus and its partially bracketed version provided by the Penn Treebank (Brill et al. , 1990).

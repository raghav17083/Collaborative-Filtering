Subsequent work on referring expression generation has expanded the logical framework to allow reference by negation (the dog that is not black) and references to multiple entities (the brown or black dogs) (van Deemter, 2002), explored different search algorithms for nding the minimal description (e.g. , Horacek (2003)) and offered different representation frameworks like graph theory (Krahmer et al. , 2003) as alternatives to AVMs. 
Recently, algorithms have been applied to the identification of sets of objects rather than individuals [Bateman 1999, Stone 2000, Krahmer, v. Erk, and Verweg 2001], and the repertoire of descriptions has been extended to boolean combinations of attributes, including negations [van Deemter 2002]. 
Notice that this use of similarity sets can be seen as a generalization of van Deemters (2002) satellite sets to relational descriptions. 
In order to refer to an intended object (the target) among others (distractors), most past work (Appelt, 1985; Dale and Haddock, 1991; Dale, 1992; Dale and Reiter, 1995; Heeman and Hirst, 1995; Horacek, 1997; Krahmer and Theune, 2002; van Deemter, 2002; Krahmer et al. , 2003) utilized attributes of the target and binary relations between the target and distractors. 
Evaluation results showed that these principles are on the right track, with significantly better performance over a previous model (van Deemter, 2002).

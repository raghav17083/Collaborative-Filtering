Many of the earlier works in coreference resolution heavily exploited domain and linguistic knowledge (Carter 1987; Rich and LuperFoy 1988; Carbonell and Brown 1988). 
Carbonell and Brown (1988) argue that pronouns prefer antecedents in the same grammatical roles. 
Introduction Since the so-called integrative approach to anaphor resolution was developed in the late 1980s (Carbonell and Brown 1988; Rich and LuperFoy 1988; Asher and Wada 1989), and its practical viability extensively tested (e.g. , Lappin and Leass 1994; Mitkov 1997, 1998), it has been common wisdom that factors determining the antecedents of anaphors divide into filters and preferences. 
The systems described in (Asher and Wada, 1988) (Carbonell and Brown, 1988) and (Rich and Luperfoy, 1988) are examples of the mixed evaluation strategy. 
Much of the earlier work in anaphora resolution heavily exploited domain and linguistic knowledge (Sidner 1979; Carter 1987; Rich and LuperFoy 1988; Carbonell and Brown 1988), which was difficult both to represent and to process, and which required considerable human input.

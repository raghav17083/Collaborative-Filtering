Comparable corpora have been studied extensively in the literature (e.g. ,(Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1995; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Franz et al. , 1998; Ballesteros and Croft, 1998; Masuichi et al. , 2000; Sadat et al. , 2003)), but transliteration in the context of comparable corpora has not been well addressed. 
Our approach The work of (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) noted that if an English word e is the translation of a Chinese word c, then the contexts of the two words are similar. 
Rapp (1995) verified this assumption between English and German. 
On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.

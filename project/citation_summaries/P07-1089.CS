A tree sequence to string rule  174 A tree-sequence to string translation rule in a forest is a triple <L, R, A>, where L is the tree sequence in source language, R is the string containing words and variables in target language, and A is the alignment between the leaf nodes of L and R. This definition is similar to that of (Liu et al. 2007, Zhang et al. 2008a) except our treesequence is defined in forest. 
Based on these grammars, a great number of SMT models have been recently proposed, including string-to-string model (Synchronous FSG) (Brown et al., 1993; Koehn et al., 2003), tree-to-string model (TSG-string) (Huang et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007), string-totree model (string-CFG/TSG) (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006), tree-to-tree model (Synchronous CFG/TSG, Data-Oriented Translation) (Chiang, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Zhang et al., 2007; Bod, 2007; Quirk wt al., 2005; Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003) and so on. 
1 Introduction Recently linguistically-motivated syntax-based translation method has achieved great success in statistical machine translation (SMT) (Galley et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006, 2007; Zhang et al., 2007, 2008a; Mi et al., 2008; Mi and Huang 2008; Zhang et al., 2009). 
Our rule extraction algorithm is an extension of that presented at (Chiang, 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007). 
Among these advances, forest-based modeling (Mi et al., 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008) and tree sequence-based modeling (Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008a) are two interesting modeling methods with promising results reported.

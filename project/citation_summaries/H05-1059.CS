3 Related Works Tsuruoka and Tsujii (2005) proposed a bidirectional POS tagger, in which the order of inference is handled with the easiest-first heuristic. 
We processed the texts with the GENIA tagger (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005; Tsuruoka et al., 2005), a bidirectional inference based tagger that analyzes English sentences and outputs the base forms, part-of-speech tags, chunk tags, and named entity tags in a tab-separated format2. 
By using deterministic search, it obtains an error rate of 2.73%, a 5.9% relative error reduction 760 over the previous best deterministic algorithm (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005). 
The upper half of the table shows the performance using the correct POSs in the Penn Treebank, and the lower half shows the performance using the POSs given by a POS tagger (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005).

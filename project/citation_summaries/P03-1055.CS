Finally, since non-projective constructions often involve long-distance dependencies, the problem is closely related to the recovery of empty categories and non-local dependencies in constituency-based parsing (Johnson, 2002; Dienes and Dubey, 2003; Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2004; Cahill et al. , 2004; Levy and Manning, 2004; Campbell, 2004). 
Dienes and Dubey (2003b) integrate the results of their detection task into their own PCFG parser, and report 81.5% precision and 68.7% recall (F 1 = 74.6%) on the combined task of detection and resolution. 
Jn is Johnson (2002); DD is Dienes and Dubey (2003b); Pres is the present work. 
6 Empty Categories: Approach Most learningbased, phrasestructurebased (PSLB) work9 on recovering empty categories has fallen into two classes: those which integrate empty category recovery into the parser (Dienes and Dubey, 2003a; Dienes and Dubey, 2003b) and those which recover empty categories from parser output in a postprocessing step (Johnson, 2002; Levy and Manning, 2004).

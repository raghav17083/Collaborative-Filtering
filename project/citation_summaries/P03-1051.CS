3.2.2 Arabic Segmentation Features An Arabic segmenter similar to (Lee et al. , 2003) provides the segmentation features.

In the first, a 6-gram language model was trained on the same web-mined collection after each of the words in the collection was segmented into its constituent prefix, stem, and suffix (in this order) using language model based stemmer (Lee et al. , 2003). 
While (Lee et al. , 2003) develop accurate segmentation models of Arabic surface word forms using manually segmented data, we rely instead on the translated context in the target language, leveraging the manually constructed lexical gloss from BAMA to select the appropriate segmented sense for each Arabic source word.

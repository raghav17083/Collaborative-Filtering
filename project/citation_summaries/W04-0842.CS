The system based on the HMM tagger (Molina et al. , 2004), 6Scoring was performed with a re-implementation of the conlleval script.


More recently, variants of the generative HMM have been applied to WSD (Molina et al. , 2002; Molina et al. , 2004) and evaluated also on Senseval data, showing performance comparable to the first sense baseline.

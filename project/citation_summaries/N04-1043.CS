An alternative way of incorporating the crosslingual predicate clusters would follow (Miller et al., 2004), namely encoding the cluster membership as an additional feature in the supervisedlearning procedure of the baseline event tagger. 
This method has been shown to be quite successful in named entity recognition (Miller et al. 2004) and dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008). 
These techniques are widely used in NLP applications, including language modeling, information extraction, and dialogue processing (Haghighi et al. , 2005; Sera n and Eugenio, 2004; Miller et al. , 2004). 
Inducing features for taggers by clustering has been tried by several researchers (Kazama et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2004). 
In this work, we analyze a simple technique of using word clusters generated from unlabeled text, which has been shown to improve performance of dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008), Chinese word segmentation (Liang, 2005) and NER (Miller et al., 2004).

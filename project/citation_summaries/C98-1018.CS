Other vocalizations are defined similarly: 53 define PerfActive \[a*\]/\V ; define PerfPassive \[u* i\]/\V ; define ImperfPassive \[u a*\]/\V ; Given the definitions above, xfst will evaluate the expressions on the left below, indicating the intersection of a root, a pattern and a vocalization, and return a language consisting of the single string on the right, an interdigitated but still morphophonemic stem (Beesley, 1998a). 
6 Related work The application of machine learning methods to Arabic morphology and PoS tagging appears to be somewhat limited and recent, compared to the vast descriptive and rule-based literature particularly on morphology (Kay, 1987; Beesley, 1990; Kiraz, 1994; Beesley, 1998; Cavalli-Sfora et al. , 2000; Soudi, 2002). 
E.g., From the underlying root \[hayib\]: haaba 'he feared' and yahaabu 'he fears' Stem allomorphs : Perfect: -biband-haabImperfect: -haband-haabIn the relevant literature (e.g. , Beesley, 1998; Kiraz, 1994), verbs belonging to the above classes are all assumed to have the pattern CVCVC. 
There are several variations of this method that produce the same effect (Beesley, 1998d), with different penalties in the size of the resulting transducer or in the performance; but in the end the constraint of discontiguous dependencies is easily accomplished using finite-state techniques. 
Consonant spreading, as in Form IX and Form XII, and biliteral roots also use the morphophonemic X symbol (Beesley, 1998c).

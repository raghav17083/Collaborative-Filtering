The most important problem is which principle should be used in parsing the given sentence /Schubert 1984/. 
The modifiers in both cases are preferably attached contrary to expectations on the basis of syntactic preferences (see Schubert 1984, 1986; Wilks, Huang, and Fass 1985). 
Preference is also mentioned in a linguistic controversy started by Frazier and Fodor (1979) with their principles of right association and minimal attachment (Schubert 1984). 
Schubert (1984; 1986) presents a number of sentences that he claims show a preference for attachment that he claims cannot be explained on the basis of structural, syntactic preferences. 
(ii) Schubert Schubert (1984) presents some of the above counter-examples in an attack on syntactically based methods.

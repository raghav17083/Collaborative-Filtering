The next steps in this research will include:  Investigating further the relationship between prosody and syntax, including the different roles of phrase breaks and prominences in marking syntactic structure, 20  Improving the prosodic labeling algorithm by incorporating intonation and syntactic/semantic information,  Incorporating the automatically labeled information in the parser of the SRI Spoken Language System (Moore, Pereira and Murveit 1989),  Modeling the break indices statistically as a function of syntactic structure,  Speeding up the parser when using the prosodic information; the expectation is that pruning out syntactic hypotheses that are incompatible with the prosodic pattern observed can both improve accuracy and speed up the parser overall.

Chinese sentences are first parsed by Stanford PCFG parser which uses Penn Chinese Treebank as the training corpus (Levy and Manning, 2003). 
5 Multilingual Parsing Most research on parsing has focused on English and parsing performance on other languages is generally significantly lower.3 Recently, there have been some attempts to adapt parsers developed for English to other languages (Levy and Manning, 2003; Cowan and Collins, 2005).

See Levy and Manning (2003) for a similar discussion of Chinese and the Penn Chinese Treebank. 
Interest in parsing models for languages other than English has been growing, starting with work on Czech (Collins et al. , 1999) and Chinese (Bikel and Chiang, 2000; Levy and Manning, 2003).

One approach to this problem is to refine parsing algorithms by developing techniques such as restrictions, structure-sharing, and lazy unification that reduce the amount of structure that is stored and hence the need for copying of features structures (Shieber, 1985; Pereira, 1985; Karttunen and Kay, 1985; Wroblewski, 1987; Gerdemann, 1989; Godden, 1990; Kogure, 1990; Emele, 1991; Tomabechi, 1991; Harrison and Ellison, 1992)). 
Different versions of structure sharing were employed by Pereira (1985) as well as Karttunen and Kay (1985). 
5 Unification algorithms allowing data-structure sharing (DSS unification algorithms) are based on two approaches: the Boyer and Moore approach, which was originally developed for term unification in theorem-proving (Boyer & Moore, 1972) and was adopted by Pereira (1985); and the lazy copying suggested by Karttnnen ~nd Kay (1985). 
Pereira (1985) describes a more sophisticated version of structure-sharing. 
Therefore, various 'quasi-destructive' algorithms (Karttunen, 1986; Kogure, 1990; Tomabechi, 1991) and algorithms using 'skeletal' DACS with updates (Pereira, 1985; Emele, 1991) have been proposed, which attempt to minimize copying.

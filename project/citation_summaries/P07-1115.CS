In addition, lexical information (e.g. subcategorization, lexical classes) can now be acquired automatically from parsed data (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003; Schulte im Walde, 2006; Preiss et al. , 2007). 
Our system is based on a approach similar to that of the well-known Cambridge subcategorization acquisition system for English (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Preiss et al., 2007). 
We introduce a novel approach to verb clustering which involves the use of (i) a recent subcategorization frame (SCF) acquisition system (Preiss et al., 2007) which produces rich lexical, SCF and syntactic data, (ii) novel syntactic-semantic feature sets extracted from this data which incorporate a variety of linguistic information, including SPs, and (iii) a new variation of spectral cluster638 ing based on the MNCut algorithm (Meila and Shi, 2001) which is well-suited for dealing with the resulting, high dimensional feature space. 
Of course, the number of frames depends on the language, the corpus, the domain and the information taken into account (for example, (Preiss et al., 2007) used a list of 168 predefined frames for English which abstract over lexically-governed prepositions). 
As both lexicons were extracted from the same corpus data, the improvement can be attributed to improved parser and SCF acquisition performance (Preiss et al., 2007).

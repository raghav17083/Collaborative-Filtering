It has been shown that VE can significantly extend the modeling power of Bayesian networks without complicating the fundamental inference methodology (Bilmes, 2004; Reynolds and Bilmes, 2005).


For example, Reynolds and Bilmes (2005) use VE that explicitly favors self transitions in dynamic Bayesian networks.

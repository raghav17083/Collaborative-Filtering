Corresponding manipulations in the form of tree transformations for dependency-based parsers have recently gained more interest (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; Hall and Novak, 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Nilsson et al. , 2006) but are still less studied, partly because constituency-based parsing has dominated the field for a long time, and partly because dependency structures have less structure to manipulate than constituent structures.


This study is concerned with two such phenomena, coordination and verb groups, for which tree transformations have been shown to improve parsing accuracy for MaltParser on Czech (Nilsson et al. , 2006).


Nilsson et al. tried to transform the tree representation of a treebank into a more suitable representation for data-driven dependency parsers (Nilsson et al., 2006; Nilsson et al., 2007).

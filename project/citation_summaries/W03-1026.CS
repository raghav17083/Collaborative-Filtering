2.2 A maximum-entropy NER model with postclassification To establish a baseline spoken Chinese NER model, we selected a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach since this is currently the single most accurate approach known for recognizing named entities in text (Tjong Kim Sang et al. , 2002, 2003, Jing et al. , 2003) 1. 
Named entity recognition based on charactertagging has shown better accuracy than wordbased methods (H.Jing et al. ,2003). 
Some machine learning algorithms also have been investigated in Chinese NER, including HMM (Yu et al. , 1998; Jing et al. , 2003), class-based language model (Gao et al. , 2005; Wu et al. , 2005), RRM (Guo et al. , 2005; Jing et al. , 2003), etc. However, when a machine learning-based NER system is directly employed in a new domain, its performance usually degrades. 
2.1 The Statistical Classifiers Good performance in many natural language processing tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, shallow parsing and named entity recognition, has been shown to depend heavily on integrating many sources of information (Zhang et al. , 2002; Jing et al. , 2003; Ittycheriah et al. , 2003). 
To compare our system to the IBM baseline described in (Jing et al. 2003), we need to evaluate our system on the same corpus as they used.

1 Brill and Marcus (1992) use a single grammatical rule in the test phase to supplement the rules their system learns, but no grammatical knowledge is used in the learning phase. 
The text is tagged using the Brill tagger (Brill, 1992) and a translation is carried out using a manually defined mapping from the syntactic tags assigned by Brill (Penn Tree Bank tags (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1993)) onto the simpler part-of-speech categories associated with LDOCE senses 6. 
They include such topics as: work with various corpus manipulation and annotation tools, use of various POS taggers and their comparison (Brill, 1992; Tufis and Mason, 1998), development of morphophonological rules in PC-Kimmo (Antworth, 1990), understanding and manipulating content from WordNet databases (Fellbaum, 1998), aligning bitext, using and evaluating a machine translation system, developing a phrasestructure grammar for syntactic and then semantic chart parsing, experimenting with information retrieval, working with a speech toolkit to develop a simple application, or developing knowledge for a text generation engine (Tomita and Nyberg, 1988). 
Brill's results demonstrate that this approach can outperform the Hidden Markov Model approaches that are frequently used for part-of-speech tagging (Jelinek, 1985; Church, 1988; DeRose, 1988; Cutting et al. , 1992; Weischedel et al. , 1993), as well as showing promise for other applications. 
According to Brill (1992) 'there is a very small amount of general linguistic knowledge built into the system, but no language-specific knowledge'.

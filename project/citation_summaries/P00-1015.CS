We extracted Base NPs (noun-noun pairs) from the Encarta 1 English corpus using the tool developed by Xun et al (2000).


Inspired by the algorithms of identifying BaseNP and Chunk[Xun, et al. 2000], we propose a hybrid NER model which emphasizes on combining coarse particle features (POS Model) with fine particle features (Word Model).

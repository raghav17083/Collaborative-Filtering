This corpus contains about 53,700 sentences and a fixed split between training and testing which has been used in other researches (Gildea and Jurasky, 2002; Surdeanu et al. , 2003; Hacioglu et al. , 2003; Chen and Rambow, 2003; Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003; Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Pradhan et al. , 2003). 
For instance, Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003) reported that a CCG-based parser gives improved results over the Collins parser. 
Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003) report that using features extracted from a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) representation improves semantic labeling performance on core arguments. 
In order to generalize the path feature (see Table 1 in Section 3) which is probably the most salient (while being the most data sparse) feature for SRL, previous work has extracted features from other syntactic representations, such as CCG derivations (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003) and dependency trees (Hacioglu, 2004) or integrated features from different parsers (Pradhan et al. , 2005b).

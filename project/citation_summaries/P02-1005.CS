One success in factoid question answering is pattern based systems, either manually constructed (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2002) or machine learned (Cui et al. , 2004). 
Opportunities include explicit semantic representations for capturing the content of questions and documents, deep inferential mechanisms (Moldovan et al. , 2002), and attempts to model task-specific influences in informationseeking environments (Freund et al. , 2005). 
(Harabagiu et al. , 2001; Moldovan et al. , 2002)); (2) a combination of language processes that transform questions and candidate answers in logic representations such that reasoning systems can select the correct answer based on their proofs (cf. 
Deep linguistic analysis has been found useful in factoid question answering (Moldovan et al. , 2002) and has been used for definitional questions (Xu et al. , 2004; Harabagiu et al. , 2003). 
While probabilistic or web-based methods for answer validation have been previously explored in the literature (Magnini et al. , 2002), these approaches have modeled the relationship between a question and a (correct) answer in terms of relevance and have not tried to approximate the deeper semantic phenomena that are involved in determining answerhood.

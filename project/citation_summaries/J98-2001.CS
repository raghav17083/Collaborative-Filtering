Preliminary Empirical Work As mentioned above, the architecture of our system is motivated by the results concerning definite description use in our corpus, discussed in Poesio and Vieira (1998). 
In their reliability study, (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) found a fair agreement among annotators (K = .76) concerning which NPS were anaphoric and which ones were not, and about 95% agreement on antecedents for those definite descriptions that all subjects ideatiffed as anaphoric; but no agreement on identif.ving bridging references (K=.24), and often different antecedents were indicated for those that all annotators classified as bridges. 
902 Furthermore, the relation between bridging descriptions and their anchors may be arbitrarily complex (Clark, 1977; Sidnm; 1979; Prince, 1981; Strand, 1996) and our own results indicate that the stone description may relate to different anchors in a text, which makes it difficult to decide what the intended anchor and the intended link are (Poesio and Vieira, 1998). 
Researchers at Essex were responsible for the coreference markup scheme developed in MATE (Poesio et al, 1999; Poesio, 2004a) and have annotated corpora using this scheme including a subset of the Penn Treebank (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), and the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2004a). 
2.3 A Study of Definite Description Use In the experiments discussed in Poesio and Vieira (1998) we asked our subjects to classify all definite description uses in our two corpora.

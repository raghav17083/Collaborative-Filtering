Concerning the use of kernels for NLP, interesting models and results are described, for example, in (Collins and Duffy, 2002), (Moschitti et al., 2008), (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2003), (Cumby and Roth, 2003), (Shen et al., 2003), (Cancedda et al., 2003), (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004), (Daume III and Marcu, 2004), (Kazama and Torisawa, 2005), (Kudo et al., 2005), (Titov and Henderson, 2006), (Moschitti et al., 2006), (Moschitti and Bejan, 2004) or (Toutanova et al., 2004). 
An efficient algorithm to compute tree kernels was given by Moschitti (2006a) which runs in close to linear time in the size of the input trees. 
The algorithm for the efficient evaluation of  for the syntactic tree kernel (STK) has been widely discussed in (Collins and Duffy, 2002) whereas its fast evaluation is proposed in (Moschitti, 2006b), so we only describe the equations of the partial tree kernel (PTK). 
Moreover, as shown in (Basili and Moschitti, 2005; Moschitti, 2006), there are other tree kernel functions that generate different fragment types. 
In contrast, Zanzotto&Moschitti (2006) proposed a machine-learning based approach which reaches a high accuracy by only using the available RTE data.

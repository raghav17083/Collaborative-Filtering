In the future probabilistic reasoning frameworks as proposed by (Narayanan and Jurafsky, 2005) in combination with ontology-based coherence measures as proposed by (Loos and Porzel, 2004) constitute promising approaches for handling problems of construal, whether it be on a pragmatic, semantic, syntactic or phonological level. 
Given the basic distinction between written text and spoken utterances, the only sense disambiguation results performed on speech data stemming from human interactions with dialogue systems have been reported by Loos and Porzel (2004), who compared both dataand knowledge-driven sense disambiguation on the same set of actual speech data. 
This is especially important for a later semantic disambiguation of the unknown term (Loos and Porzel, 2004). 
For our study we employ the SMARTKOM (Wahlster, 2003) sense-tagged corpus employed in the word sense disambiguation study reported by (Loos and Porzel, 2004). 
The ensuing distance between two concepts, e.g. a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7a9a3a11a10a6a12 is then defined as the minimum score derived between a3a6a5 and a3a11a10 . So far, a number of additional normalization steps, contextual extensions and relation-specific weighted scores have been proposed and evaluated (Gurevych et al. , 2003a; Porzel et al. , 2003a; Loos and Porzel, 2004) The ONTOSCORE module currently employs two knowledge sources: an ontology (about 800 concepts and 200 relations) and a lexicon (ca.

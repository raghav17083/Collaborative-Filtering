Then, the syntax rules can also fall into two categories according to whether equipping with generalization capability (Chiang, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008a): 1) Initial rules (Initial): all leaf nodes of this rule are terminals. 
Among these advances, forest-based modeling (Mi et al., 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008) and tree sequence-based modeling (Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008a) are two interesting modeling methods with promising results reported. 
1 Introduction The use of various synchronous grammar based formalisms has been a trend for statistical machine translation (SMT) (Wu, 1997; Eisner, 2003; Galley et al., 2006; Chiang, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008). 
Further, the syntax rules can be divided into three categories according to the lexicalization levels (Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008a): 1) Fully lexicalized (FLex): all leaf nodes in both the source and target sides are lexicons (terminals) 2) Unlexicalized (ULex): all leaf nodes in both the 46       Figure 2: Some rules can be extracted by the system used in (Zhang et al., 2008a) from the sentence pair in Figure 1. 
They can be roughly divided into three categories: string-to-tree models (e.g., (Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008)), tree-to-string models (e.g., (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006)), and tree-totree models (e.g., (Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008)).

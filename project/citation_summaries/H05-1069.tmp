W06-2007:1	As described above, we prepared two sets of training examples for each English word sense to disambiguate: one set was translated word-byword by looking up a bilingual dictionary, as proposed in (Wang and Carroll, 2005), and the other translated using MT software.
---------------------------------------------------
W06-2007:2	2 Acquisition of Sense Examples Wang and Carroll (2005) proposed an automatic approach to acquire sense examples from large amount of Chinese text and English-Chinese and Chinese-English dictionaries.
---------------------------------------------------
W06-2007:3	Wang and Carroll (2005) proposed to use monolingual corpora and bilingual dictionaries to automatically acquire sense examples.
---------------------------------------------------
W06-2007:4	Among them, systems under the multilingual paradigm have shown great promise (Gale et al. , 1992; Dagan and Itai, 1994; Diab and Resnik, 2002; Ng et al. , 2003; Li and Li, 2004; Chan and Ng, 2005; Wang and Carroll, 2005).
---------------------------------------------------
W06-2007:5	This paper is organised as follows: Section 2 revisits the process of acquiring sense examples proposed in (Wang and Carroll, 2005) and then describes our adapted approach.
---------------------------------------------------
W06-2007:6	The intuition is that although machine translated text contains noise, features like word ordering, POS tags 1 A similar process took 15 minutes per noun as reported in (Chan and Ng, 2005), and about an hour for 20 nouns as reported in (Wang and Carroll, 2005).

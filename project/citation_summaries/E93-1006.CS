Bod (1993b) shows that DOP can be implemented using context-free parsing techniques. 
1 Goodman's approach is different from Bod (1993-1995) and Sima'an (1995) in that it returns best parses that cannot be generated by the DOP1 model (see Bod, 1996 for a reply to Goodman's paper). 
In Bod (1992, 1993a), a first instantiation of this model is given, called DOP1, which uses (1) labelled trees for the utterance analyses, (2) subtrees for the fragments, (3) nodesubstitution for combining subtrees, and (4), the sum of the probabilities of all distinct ways of generating an analysis as a def'mition of the probability of that analysis. 
Most of the methods that are being suggested include some kind of Machine Learning, such as history based grammars and decision tree models (Black et al. , 1993; Magerman, 1995), training or inducing statistical grammars (Black, Garside and Leech, 1993; Pereira and Schabes, 1992; Schabes et al. , 1993), or other techniques (Bod, 1993). 
Bod (1993c) shows how to approximate this most probable parse using a Monte Carlo algorithm.

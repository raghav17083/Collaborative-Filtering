In (Schubert, 2002) we made some comparisons between our project and earlier work in knowledge extraction (e.g. , (muc, 1993; muc, 1995; muc, 1998; Berland and Charniak, 1999; Clark and Weir, 1999; Hearst, 1998; Riloff and Jones, 1999)) and in discovery of selectional preferences (e.g. , (Agirre and Martinez, 2001; Grishman and Sterling, 1992; Resnik, 1992; Resnik, 1993; Zernik, 1992; Zernik and Jacobs, 1990)). 
(Zernik, 1992a, 1992b) describes a method to distinguish thematic relations (e.g. , expressed concerns), which take on syntactic variations in the corpus, and sentential relations (e.g. , preferred stocks) that do not. 
The average rates are : 27 % no disambiguation 70 % correct disambiguation 3 % wrong disambiguation The LEXTER-K project : knowledge extraction from large technical text corpora LEXTER is a Terminology Extraction Software (Bourigault, 1992a, 1992b). 
This method ("Asking the right questions of the corpus") is similar to the strategy described in this paper, and we agree with Zernik's general line of thinking : "In order for a program to interpret natural language text, it must train on and exploit word connections in the text under interpretation (Zernik, 1992a)". 
Among early efforts, one might count work on deriving selectional preferences (e.g., Zernik (1992); Resnik (1993); Clark and Weir (1999)) or partial predicateargument structure (e.g., Abney (1996)) as steps in the direction of open knowledge extraction, though typically few of the tuples obtained (often a type of subject plus a verb, or a verb plus a type of object) can be interpreted as complete items of world knowledge.

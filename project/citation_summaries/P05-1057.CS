1.2 Related Work Recently, discriminative methods for alignment have rivaled the quality of IBM Model 4 alignments (Liu et al., 2005; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005; Taskar et al., 2005; Moore et al., 2006; Fraser and Marcu, 2007b). 
These approaches include an enhanced HMM alignment model that uses part-ofspeech tags (Toutanova et al. , 2002), a log-linear combination of IBM translation models and HMM models (Och and Ney, 2003), techniques that rely on dependency relations (Cherry and Lin, 2003), and a log-linear combination of IBM Model 3 alignment probabilities, POS tags, and bilingual dictionary coverage (Liu et al. , 2005). 
In contrast, adding new features to some supervised systems (Liu et al. , 2005; Moore, 2005; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005) is easy, but the need of annotated data is a problem. 
In 2005, however, several independent efforts (Liu et al. , 2005; Fraser and Marcu, 2005; Ayan et al. , 2005; Taskar et al. , 2005; Moore, 2005; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005) demonstrated that discriminatively trained models can equal or surpass the alignment accuracy of the standard models, if the usual unlabeled bilingual training corpus is supplemented with human-annotated word alignments for only a small subset of the training data. 
(Liu et al. , 2005) presented a log-linear model combining IBM Model 3 trained in both directions with heuristic features which resulted in a 1-to-1 alignment.

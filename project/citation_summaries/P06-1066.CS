There have been considerable amount of efforts to improve the reordering model in SMT systems, ranging from the fundamental distance-based distortion model (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003), flat reordering model (Wu, 1996; Zens et al. , 2004; Kumar et al. , 2005), to lexicalized reordering model (Tillmann, 2004; Kumar et al. , 2005; Koehn et al. , 2005), hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005), and maximum entropy-based phrase reordering model (Xiong et al. , 2006). 
3 Tree Kernel-based Phrase Reordering Model 3.1 Kernel-based Classifier Solution to Phrase Reordering In this paper, phrase reordering is recast as a classification issue as done in previous work (Xiong et al., 2006 & 2008; Zhang et al., 2007a). 
5 Experiments and Analysis In this section we conducted a number of experiments to demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed LABTG based SMT when compared with two baseline systems: Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), a state-of-the-art phrase-based system and MEBTG (Xiong et al., 2006), a BTG based system. 
For example, in Figure 2, consider target first-word features extracted from an inverted reordering example (Xiong et al., 2006) in MEBTG, in which first words on two blocks are both "the". 
Recently, many phrase reordering methods have been proposed, ranging from simple distancebased distortion model (Koehn  et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), flat reordering model (Wu, 1997; Zens et al., 2004), lexicalized reordering model (Tillmann, 2004; Kumar and Byrne, 2005), to hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005; Setiawan et al., 2007) and classifier-based reordering model with linear features (Zens and Ney, 2006; Xiong et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007a; Xiong et al., 2008).

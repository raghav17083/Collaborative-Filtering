(Varges and Mellish, 2001) also aims to reduce the authoring burden of domain-specific generation; however, they seem to use a special purpose semantic annotation rather than pre-existing application semantics, and their task is defined in terms of the Penn Treebank, so hand-authored syntax is used as input. 
In hybrid symbolic-statistical approaches, White [2004] prunes edges in chart realisation using n-gram models, and Varges uses quantitative methods for determining the weights on instance features in instance-based generation [Varges and Mellish, 2001]. 
In contrast to all the approaches mentioned above, our language generator uses overgeneration and ranking techniques (Langkilde, 2000; Varges and Mellish, 2001). 
[Varges and Mellish, 2001] present an approach to sentence realization that employs an instance-based ranker trained on a semantically annotated subset of the Penn treebank II (Whos News texts). 
This is in contrast to generation systems such as the ones described in (Langkilde, 2000) and (Varges and Mellish, 2001).

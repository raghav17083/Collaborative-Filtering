1 Introduction In the Message Understanding Conference (MUC), Named entity Recognition aims to classify proper nouns, dates, time, measures and locations, etc. Many researchers adapt their systems from MUC to the biomedical domain, such as (Fukuda et al 1998), (Proux et al 1998), (Nobata et al 2000), (Collier et al 2000), (Gaizauskas et al 2000), (Kazama et al 2002), (Takeuchi et al 2002), (Lee et al 2003) and (Zhou et al 2004). 
This is consistent with earlier explanation for why POS features are not so useful in biomedical NER (Nobata et al. 2000; Takeuchi and Collier 2002). 
Another reason for low accuracies is that biomedical named entities are essentially hard to recognize using standard feature sets compared with the named entities in newswire articles (Nobata et al. , 2000). 
This kind of features have been widely used in both newswire NER system, such as (Zhou and Su 2002), and biomedical NER system, such as (Nobata et al. 1999; Gaizauskas et al. 2000; Collier et al. 2000; Takeuchi and Collier 2002; Kazama et al. 2002). 
Since in previous work, many NER systems have been applied successfully in newswire domain (Zhou and Su 2002; Bikel et al. 1999; Borthwich et al. 1999), more and more explorations have been done to port existing NER system into biomedical domain (Kazama et al. 2002; Takeuchi et al. 2002; Nobata et al. 1999 and 2000; Collier et al. 2000; Gaizauskas et al. 2000; Fukuda et al. 1998; Proux et al. 1998).

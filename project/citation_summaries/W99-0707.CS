Memory-based learning (Stanfill and Waltz, 1986; Aha et al. , 1991; Daelemans et al. , 1999b) is a supervised inductive learning algorithm for learning classification tasks. 
In the best case with the editing techniques used by (Daelemans et al. , 1999b), the drop in performance was 0.66% in the chunk tag accuracy with 50% usage (i.e. 50% of the training items were used). 
Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank the following people for their discussions and advice during this work; the reviewers of this paper for some helpful comments, Antal van den Bosch for providing the data from (Daelemans et al. , 1999b) for our analysis, Ronan Reilly for his discussions of this work, Walter Daelemans & other members of the CNTS who made the first authors visit to CNTS an enjoyable and productive stay. 
Subsequently, the selected sentences are POStagged and parsed using the Memory Based Shallow Parser (Daelemans et al., 1999). 
A promising technique here is memory-based learning1 (MBL) (Daelemans et al. , 1999a), where a task is redescribed as a classification problem.

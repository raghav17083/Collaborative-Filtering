9 Treatments of quantifier scope in Montague grammar (Montague 1973; Dowty et al. 1981; Cooper 1983), transformational grammar (Reinhart 1983; May 1985; Heim 1982; Roberts 1987), and computational linguistics (Hobbs and Shieber 1987; Moran 1988; Alshawi et al. 1989) have depended implicitly or explicitly on a constraint on possible logical forms to explain why examples 1 such as 1. 
We will not be discussing the process of quantifier scoping here: a scoping mechanism for the CLE has already been described by Moran (1988), and a later version is described by Pereira in Alshawi et al. 
LUNAR (Woods 1986), TEAM (Martin, Appelt, and Pereira 1986), and the SRI Core Language Engine as described by Moran (1988; Moran and Pereira 1992) all employ scope rules of this sort. 
Treatments of quantifier scope in Montague grammar (Montague, 1973; Dowty et al. , 1981; Cooper, 1983), transformational grammar (Reinhart, 1983; May, 1985; Helm, 1982; Roberts, 1987) and computational linguistics (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987; Moran, 1988) have depended implicitly or explicitly on a constraint on possible logical forms to explain why examples 1 such as (1) * A woman who saw every man disliked him are ungrammatical, and why in examples such as (2) Every man saw a friend of his (3) Every admirer of a picture of himself is vain the every , noun phrase must have wider scope than the a noun phrase if the pronoun in each example is assumed to be bound by its antecedent. 
The details of two versions of the CLE quantifier scoping mechanism are discussed by Moran (1988) and Pereira (A1shawl et al. 1988).

The Chinese sentences in both the development and test corpus are segmented and POS tagged by ICTCLAS (Zhang et al. , 2003). 
Segmentation performance has been improved significantly, from the earliest maximal match (dictionary-based) approaches to HMM-based (Zhang et al., 2003) approaches and recent state-of-the-art machine learning approaches such as maximum entropy (MaxEnt) (Xue and Shen, 2003), support vector machine (SVM) (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001), conditional random fields (CRF) (Peng and McCallum, 2004), and minimum error rate training (Gao et al., 2004). 
ICTCLAS is developed by Chinese Academy of Science, the precision of which is 97.58% on tagging general words (Huaping Zhang et al., 2003).

The granularity of general PoS tagging is smaller than what is targeted in this paper because terms representing domain specific concepts are more likely to be compound words and sometimes even phrases, such as   (file manager),   (description of concurrency), etc Even though current general word segmentation and PoS tagging can achieve precision of 99.6% and 97.58%, respectively (Huaping Zhang et al., 2003),   its performance for domain specific corpus is much less satisfactory (Luning Ji et al., 2007), which is why terminology extraction algorithms need to be developed.

 MaxSim (Chan and Ng, 2008)MaxSim calculates a similarity score by comparing items in the translation against the reference. 
Banerjee and Lavie (2005) and Chan and Ng (2008) use WordNet, and Zhou et al. 
However, there is little agreement on what types of knowledge are helpful: Some suggestions concentrate on lexical information, e.g., by the integration of word similarity information as in Meteor (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) or MaxSim (Chan and Ng, 2008). 
(2006)), or by using linguistic evidence, mostly lexical similarity (METEOR, Banerjee and Lavie (2005); MaxSim, Chan and Ng (2008)), or syntactic overlap (Owczarzak et al. 
1 Introduction B (Papineni et al., 2002) was one of the first automatic evaluation metrics for machine translation (MT), and despite being challenged by a number of alternative metrics (Melamed et al., 2003; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Snover et al., 2006; Chan and Ng, 2008), it remains the standard in the statistical MTliterature.Callison-Burchetal.(2006)havesubjected B to a searching criticism, with two realworld case studies of significant failures of correlation between B and human adequacy/fluency judgments.Bothcasesinvolvecomparisonsbetween statistical MT systems and other translation methods (human post-editing and a rule-based MT system), and they recommend that the use of B be restrictedtocomparisonsbetweenrelatedsystemsor different versions of the same systems.

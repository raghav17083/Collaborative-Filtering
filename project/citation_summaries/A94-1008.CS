The representation is introduced in (Voutilainen and Tapanainen 1993; Voutilainen 1994); here, only the main characteristics are given:  Each word boundary is explicitly represented as one of five alternatives: the sentence boundary "@@" the boundary separating juxtaposed finite clauses "@/" -centre-embedded (sequences of) finite clauses are flanked with "@<" and "@>" the plain word boundary "@"  Each word is furnished with a tag indicating a surface-syntactic function (subject, premoditier, auxiliary, main verb, adverbial, etc.). 
, 1995; Tapanainen & Voutilainen, 1994). 
5.3 Combination of the tuggers We also tried combining the tuggers, using first the rules and then the statistics (a similar approach was also used in (Tapanainen and Voutilainen, 1994)). 
1: Preterminal symbols used for lookahead As has been reported in the literature (see Tapanainen and Voutilainen 1994; Brants and Samuelsson 1995), English is a language with a high level of homography: readings per word are around 2 (i.e. each word can be assigned in average two different tags depending on the tagset). 
As suggested e.g. by Tapanainen and Voutilainen (1994) and Chanod and Tapanainen (1995), hand-coded heuristics may be a worthwhile addition to 'strictly' grammar-based rules.

Most proper name recognizers that have been reported on in print either take as input text tagged by part-of-speech (e.g. , the systems of (Paik et al. 1993) and (Mani et al. 1993)) or perform syntactic and/or morphological analysis on all words, including capitalized ones, that are part of candidate proper names (e.g. , (Coates-Stephens 1993) and (McDonald 1993)). 
In addition, some researchers have explored the use of both local context surrounding the hypothesized proper nouns (McDonald 1993; Coates-Stephens 1991) and the larger discourse context (Mani et al. 1993) to improve the accuracy of proper noun extraction when large known-word lists are not available. 
Techniques for proper noun extraction include the use of regular grammars to delimit and identify proper nouns (Mani et al. 1993; Paik et al. 1994), the use of extensive name lists, place names, titles and "gazetteers" in conjunction with partial grammars in order to recognize proper nouns as unknown words in close proximity to known words (Cowie et al. 1992; Aberdeen et al. 1992), statistical training to learn, for example, Spanish names, from on-line corpora (Ayuso 474 Radev and McKeown Generating Natural Language Summaries et al. 1992), and the use of concept-based pattern matchers that use semantic concepts as pattern categories as well as part-of-speech information (Weischedel et al. 1993; Lehnert et al. 1993). 
Several (e.g. , (McDonald 1993), (Mani et al. 1993), (Paik et al. 1993) and (Cowie et al. 1992)) look in the local context of the candidate proper name for external information such as appositives (e.g. , in a sequence such as Robin Clark, presiden~ of Clark Co).

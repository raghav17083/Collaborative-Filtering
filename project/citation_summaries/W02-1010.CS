Many machine learning methods have been proposed to address this problem, e.g., supervised learning algorithms (Miller et al. , 2000; Zelenko et al. , 2002; Culotta and Soresen, 2004; Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et al. , 2005), semi-supervised learning algorithms (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zhang, 2004), and unsupervised learning algorithms (Hasegawa et al. , 2004). 
Most of approaches to the ACE RDC task involved supervised learning such as kernel methods (Zelenko et al. , 2002) and need richly annotated corpora which are tagged with relation instances. 
Many methods have been proposed to deal with this task, including supervised learning algorithms (Miller et al. , 2000; Zelenko et al. , 2002; Culotta and Soresen, 2004; Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et al. , 2005), semi-supervised learning algorithms (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zhang, 2004), and unsupervised learning algorithm (Hasegawa et al. , 2004).

Prior work on automatic relation extraction come in three kinds: supervised learning algorithms (Miller et al. , 2000; Zelenko et al. , 2002; Culotta and Soresen, 2004; Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et al. , 2005), semi-supervised learning algorithms (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zhang, 2004), and unsupervised learning algorithm (Hasegawa et al. , 2004).

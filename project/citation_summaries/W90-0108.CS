The basic type is also mapped onto a type (or set of types) in the concept ontology used for sentence generation, a version of Penman's Upper Model (Bateman, 1990). 
PENMAN provides structure for some of these external sources of information, including a conceptual hierarchy of relations and entities, called the Upper Model (UM) \[Bateman et aL, 1990; Bateman, 1990\]; the UM hierarchy classifies concepts according to their possibilities for realization in natural language and may be used as an interface between the organizational structures of Domain Knowledge (DK) and the grammar's inquiries. 
Mapping Domain taxonomy onto Upper Model: ILEX uses an Upper Model (a domainindependent semantic taxonomy, see Bateman (1990)), which supports the grammatical expression of entities, e.g., selection of pronoun, differentiation between mass and count entities, between things and qualities, etc. We require that the basic types in the domain taxonomy are mapped onto the upper model, to allow the entities to be grammaticalised and lexicalised appropriately. 
However, the section of the UM corresponding to noun senses seems surprisingly small for this task at least, as described in Bateman et al 1990. 
Ideational Potential: Ideational potential is represented in terms of an ontology of semantic types, a version of Penman's Upper Model (UM) (Bateman 1990; Bateman et al. 1990).

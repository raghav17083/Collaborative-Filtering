The (to our knowledge) oldest work in this area is that of Atwell (1987) who uses a POS tagger to flag POS bigrams that are unlikely according to a reference corpus.


N-gram-based approaches to the problem of error detection have been proposed and implemented in various forms by Atwell(1987), Bigert and Knutsson (2002), and Chodorow and Leacock (2000) amongst others.

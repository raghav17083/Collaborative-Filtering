In open-domain opinion extraction, some approaches use syntactic features obtained from parsed input sentences (Choi et al. , 2006; Kim and Hovy, 2006), as is commonly done in semantic role labeling. 
A notable exception is the work of Kim and Hovy (2006). 
Open-domain opinion extraction is another trend of research on opinion extraction, which aims to extract a wider range of opinions from such texts as newspaper articles (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Wiebe et al. , 2005; Choi et al. , 2006). 
Kim and Hovy (2006) integrated verb information from FrameNet and incorporated it into semantic role labeling. 
Kim and Hovy (2006) proposed a method for extracting opinion holders, topics and opinion words, in which they use semantic role labeling as an intermediate step to label opinion holders and topics.

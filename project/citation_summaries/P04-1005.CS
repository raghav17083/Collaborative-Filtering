The Johnson and Charniak (2004) approach, referred to in this document as JC04, combines the noisy channel paradigm with a tree-adjoining grammar (TAG) to capture approximately repeated elements. 
Another model of speech repair that explicitly models the structure of speech repair is that of Johnson and Charniak (2004). 
These steps result in a significant improvement in F-score over the earlier best result reported in [Charniak and Johnson 2001], where punctuation is included in both the training and testing data of the Switchboard corpus, and a significant error reduction in F-score over the latest best result [Johnson and Charniak 2004], where punctuation is ignored in both the training and testing data of the Switchboard corpus. 
In three cases, simple repeated phrases caught by (Johnson and Charniak, 2004) were also caught in some form by the partial parse partitioning.

As discussed in Weeds and Weir (2003b), the Dice Coefficient and Jaccards Coefficient are exactly simulated by = 1 in the additive type-based model and Lins Measure is almost equivalent to the harmonic mean of precision and recall in the additive MI-based model. 
This has been now an active research area for a couple of decades (Hindle, 1990; Lin, 1998; Weeds and Weir, 2003). 
title=Textual_Entailment_Resource_Pool 69 To date, most distributional similarity research concentrated on symmetric measures, such as the widely cited and competitive (as shown in (Weeds and Weir, 2003)) LIN measure (Lin, 1998): LIN(u,v) = summationtext fFVuFVv[wu(f) + wv(f)]summationtext fFVu wu(f) + summationtext fFVv wv(f) where FVx is the feature vector of a word x and wx(f) is the weight of the feature f in that words vector, set to their pointwise mutual information. 
However, it is not at all obvious that one universally best measure exists for all applications (Weeds and Weir, 2003). 
In previous work (Weeds and Weir 2003b), we experimented with weight functions based on combinatorial, probabilistic, and mutual information (MI).

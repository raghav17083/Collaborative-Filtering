Several works have addressed the problems of representing temporal information in natural language (Setzer, 2001; Hobbs and Pan, 2004; Saur et al. , 2006), extracting and/or anchoring (normalizing) temporal and event related expressions (Wiebe et al. , 1998; Mani and Wilson, 2000; Schilder and Habel, 2001; Vazov, 2001; Filatova and Hovy, 2001), and discovering the ordering of events (Mani et al. , 2003). 
The EVENT tag is used to annotate events, defined as something which occur or happen, and 1 Filatova and Hovy (2001), Schilder and Habel (2001), Setzer (2001). 
We claim, following Schilder and Habel (2001), that the semantics of temporal prepositions is rel (e, t), where rel is used to indicate the temporal relation associated with a certain preposition, t represents the meaning of the Temporal Expression (timex), and e the meaning of the event description involved. 
Systems which aim to set events on a time scale depending on their duration and according to a hierarchy of unities called granularities (Schilder and Habel, 2001); 2. 
Schilder and Habel (2001) looked beyond the core temporal expressions and into prepositional phrases that contained temporal relations, i.e. before, during, etc and introduced the notion of noun phrases as event-denoting expressions.

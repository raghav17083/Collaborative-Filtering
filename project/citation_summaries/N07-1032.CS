More specifically, when applying an unsupervised WSI system on different datasets, one cannot be sure that the same set of parameters is appropriate for all datasets (Karakos et al., 2007).


is in fact the Shannon entropy H(p) and that limR(p) = logmaxy p(y), i.e. the negative log probability of the modal or Viterbi label (Arndt, 2001; Karakos et al. , 2007).

The greedy modes are deterministic and therefore considerably cheaper in computational terms than the equivalent n-gram method (Belz, 2005). 
Moreover, the only type of language model used in NLG are ngram models which have the additional disadvantage of a general preference for shorter realisations, which can be harmful in NLG (Belz, 2005). 
The base generator that was used in previous experiments (Belz, 2005) encoded a less structured generation space and the set of concepts it used were less fine-grained (e.g. it did not distinguish between an increase and a decrease in wind speed, considering both simply a change), and therefore it lacked some information necessary for deriving conditional probabilities for lexical choice (e.g. freshening vs. easing). 
(Belz, 2005) To incorporate the statistical component, which allows for robust generalization, per (Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995), the NLG on the target side is filtered through a language model (described above). 
Indeed NLG researchers are already starting to use BLEU (Habash, 2004; Belz, 2005) in their evaluations, as this is much cheaper and easier to organise than the human evaluations that have traditionally been used to evaluate NLG systems.

3 Memory-Based Dependency Parsing In the experiments below, we employ a data-driven deterministic dependency parser producing labeled projective dependency graphs,3 previously tested on Swedish (Nivre et al. , 2004) and English (Nivre and Scholz, 2004). 
Transitionbased parsers model the sequence of decisions of a shift-reduce parser, given previous decisions and current state, and parsing is performed by greedily choosing the highest scoring transition out of each successive parsing state or by searching for the best sequence of transitions (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2004; Sagae and Lavie, 2005; Hall et al., 2006). 
Then we will define the generative parsing model, based on the algorithm of (Nivre et al. , 2004), and propose an ISBN for this model. 
1.1 RelatedWork There has been extensive work on data-driven dependency parsingfor both projective parsing(Eisner, 1996; Paskin, 2001; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre and Scholz, 2004; McDonaldet al., 2005a) and non-projective parsing systems (Nivre and Nilsson,2005;Hall and Novak, 2005;McDonald et al., 2005b). 
To study the influence of parsing methodology, we will compare two different parsers: MaltParser (Nivre et al. , 2004) and MSTParser (McDonald et al. , 2005).

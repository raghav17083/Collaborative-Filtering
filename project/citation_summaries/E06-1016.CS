A new bootstrapped WCCM is created such that each cell mi j, corresponding to word weni and concept cenj, is populated with the number of times weni co-occurs with any word used in sense cenj . Mohammad and Hirst (2006a) used the DPCs created from the bootstrapped WCCM to attain near-upper-bound results in the task of determining word sense dominance. 
Mohammad and Hirst (2006a) proposed a way to determine the strength of association between a sense or concept and co-occurring words?the distributional profile of a concept (DPC)?without the use of manually annotated data. 
Mohammad and Hirst (2006b) used the DPC-based monolingual distributional measures of concept-distance to rank word pairs by their semantic similarity and to correct real-word spelling errors, attaining markedly better results than monolingual distributional measures of word-distance. 
A new bootstrapped WCCM is created, after a second pass of the corpus, in which the cell m ij contains the number of times any word used in sense c j co-occurs with w i .We have shown (Mohammad and Hirst, 2006) that the bootstrapped WCCM captures wordcategory cooccurrences much more accurately than the base WCCM, using the task of determining word sense dominance 3 as a test bed. 
Mohammad and Hirst (2006) propose an algorithm for inferring dominant senses without relying on distributionally similar neighbors.

In order to evaluate, we had to map automatically all WSD results to the respective WordNet version (using the mappings in (Daude et al. , 2000) which are publicly available). 
For this, we rely primarily on the WordNet sense mappings automatically generated by the work of (Daude et al. , 2000). 
As an alternative, we also tried to use publicly available mappings for wordnets (Daude et al., 2000)4 in order to create a 3.0 version of the Spanish WordNet. 
Note that contrary to the specifications, this team returned WordNet 2.1 senses, so we had to map automatically to 1.6 senses (Daude et al. , 2000). 
While the other two methods outperform the McCarthy et al. method, 3We also used a tool for mapping from WordNet 1.7 to WordNet 1.6 (Daude et al., 2000) to map the SE2-EAW noun data (originally distributed with 1.7 sense numbers) to 1.6 sense numbers.

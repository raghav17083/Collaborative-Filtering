EBMT retrieves the translation examples that are best matched to an input expression and adjusts the examples to obtain the translation (Nagao, 1981; Sadler 1989; Sato and Nagao, 1990; Sumita and Iida, 1991; Kitano, 1993; Furuse et al. , 1994; Watanabe and Maruyama, 1994; Cranias et al. , 1994; Jones, 1996; Veale and Way, 1997; Carl, 1999, Andriamanankasina et al. , 1999; Brown, 2000). 
SEMDIST is defined as the division of K (the level of the least common abstraction in the thesaurus of two words) by N (the height of the thesaurus) according to equation (2) (Sumita and Iida, 1991). 
Specifically, the semantic distance (Sumita and Iida, 1991) is calculated between the source examples and the headwords of the input sentence, and the transfer rules that contain the nearest example are used to construct the target tree structure. 
Substitution is considered as the semantic distance between two substituted words, described as Sem, which is defined using a thesaurus and ranges from 0to1.Sem is the division of K (the level of the least common abstraction in the thesaurus of two words) by N (the height of the thesaurus) according to equation (3) (Sumita and Iida, 1991). 
It has the same function as the database of parallel translations in an Example-based machine translation system (Sumita and Iida, 1991).

The initial work in the field used lexico-syntactic template patterns learned using a variety of different empirical approaches (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998; Huffman, 1995; 489 Soderland et al. , 1995). 
The ability to automatically make this distinction is necessary for the correct automatic acquisition of important lexical knowledge, such as subcategorization frames and argument structures, which is used in parsing, generation, machine translation, and information extraction (Srinivas and Joshi 1999; Stede 1998; Dorr 1997; Riloff and Schmelzenbach 1998). 
From the midnineties, there are systems that learn extraction patterns from partially annotated and unannotated data (Huffman, 1995; Riloff, 1996; Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998; Soderland, 1999). 
Applying such a model to information extraction, in AutoSlog Riloff (1993) builds a list of patterns for filling in semantic slots in a specific domain, as well as a method for automatic acquisition of case frames (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998). 
3 Semantic role identification There are number of different existing approaches for identifying semantic roles, varying from traditional parsing approaches, for example using HPSG grammars and Lexical Functional Grammars, that strongly rely on manuallydeveloped grammars and lexicons, to data-driven approaches, for example AutoSlog (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998).

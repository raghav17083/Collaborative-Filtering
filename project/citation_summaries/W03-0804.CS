For example, the syntactic feature defined in the ISLE/MILE format for lexical entries (Calzolari, et al. 2003) can be represented in RDF as follows 1 : 1 For brevity, this representation does not include the full information necessary for the RDF representation. 
The overall design of the architecture and the data model that it will instantiate have been described in Ide et al. , 2003. 
However, it is often the case that specialized tools are developed to facilitate the annotation of particular levels: examples include tools for segmentation and transcription of the speech signal like PRAAT (Boersma and Weenink, 2005) and TRANSCRIBER (Barras et al. , 1998), the SALSA tools for FrameNetstyle annotation (Burchardt et al. , 2006), and MMAX (Muller and Strube, 2003) for coreference annotation. 
Some of them are based upon syntactic structure, with PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2003) being one of the most relevant, building the annotation upon the syntactic representation of the TreeBank corpus (Marcus et al. , 1993).

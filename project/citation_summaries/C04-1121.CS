In this work, we propose a general graph representation for automatically extracting structured features from tokens and prior annotations such as part of speech, dependency triples, etc. Gamon (2004) shows that an approach using a large set of structured features and a feature selection procedure performs better than an approach that uses a few handcrafted features. 
314 4 Methodology Composite Back-off Features: The idea behind our composite back-off features is to create more generalizable, but not overly general back-off features by backing off to the part-of-speech (POS) tag of either the head word or the modifier word (but not both at once, as in Gamon (2004) and Wilson et al. 
One of the most popular techniques used for opinion mining is that of supervised machine learning, for which, many different lexical, syntactic and knowledge-based feature representations have been explored in the literature (Dave et al., 2003; Gamon, 2004; Matsumoto et al., 2005; Ng et al., 2006). 
Full Back-off Features: Both Gamon (2004) and Wilson et al. 
Also, syntactic features such as the dependency relationship of words and subtrees have been shown to effectively improve the performances of sentiment analysis (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004; Gamon, 2004; Matsumoto et al., 2005; Ng et al., 2006).

Contexts are similar to the extent that they contain similar words, and words are similar to the extent that they appear in similar contexts (Karov and Edelman, 1998). 
Since we are attempting to reduce the problem of literal/nonliteral recognition to one of word-sense disambiguation, we use an existing similarity-based word-sense disambiguation algorithm developed by (Karov & Edelman, 1998), henceforth KE. 
The sentences in the target set and feedback sets were augmented with some shallow syntactic information such as part of speech tags provided 22 Algorithm 1 KE-train: (Karov & Edelman, 1998) algorithm adapted to literal/nonliteral identification Require: S: the set of sentences containing the target word (each sentence is classified as literal/nonliteral) Require: L: the set of literal seed sentences Require: N: the set of nonliteral seed sentences Require: W: the set of words/features, w  s means w is in sentence s, s owner w means s contains w Require: epsilon1: threshold that determines the stopping condition 1: w-sim0(wx,wy) := 1 if wx = wy,0 otherwise 2: s-simI0(sx,sy) := 1, for all sx,sy  S S where sx = sy, 0 otherwise 3: i := 0 4: while (true) do 5: s-simLi+1(sx,sy) :=summationtextwxsx p(wx,sx)maxwysy w-simi(wx,wy), for all sx,sy  S L 6: s-simNi+1(sx,sy) :=summationtextwxsx p(wx,sx)maxwysy w-simi(wx,wy), for all sx,sy  S N 7: for wx,wy  W W do 8: w-simi+1(wx,wy) := braceleftBigg i = 0 summationtextsxownerwx p(wx,sx)maxsyownerwy s-simIi(sx,sy) else summationtextsxownerwx p(wx,sx)maxsyownerwys-simLi (sx,sy), s-simNi (sx,sy)} 9: end for 10: if wx,maxwyw-simi+1(wx,wy) w-simi(wx,wy)}  epsilon1 then 11: break # algorithm converges in 1epsilon1 steps. 
Our approach to word similarity to overcome data sparseness is perhaps most similar to (Karov and Edelman, 1998). 
3.2 Core Algorithm Since we are attempting to reduce the problem of literal/nonliteral recognition to one of word-sense disambiguation, TroFi makes use of an existing similarity-based word-sense disambiguation algorithm developed by (Karov & Edelman, 1998), henceforth KE.

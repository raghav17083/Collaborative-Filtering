This is particularly so if constraints are being systematically relaxed in order to handle ill-formed input (as suggested, for example, in (Weischedel and Sondheimer, 1983)) or if there is uncertainty regarding the input (as is the case for speech input, for example). 
Section 3 applies metarules (Weischedel and Sondheimer, 1983; McKelvie, 1998a; Core and Schubert, 1999) in recognizing these correspondences using standard context-free grammars. 
Introduction Weischedel and Sondheimer (1983) described two types of ill-formedness: relative (i.e. limitations of the computer system) and absolute (e.g. misspellings, mistyping, agreement violation etc). 
It shouhl be noted dmt, in contrast to certain other systems (for example, Jensen et al. 1983; Weischedel and Sondheimer 1983; V&onis 1988; Chanod et at. 
Among the work on syntactically ill-formed input has been EPISTLE (Miller 1981), the work of Weischedel and Sondheimer (Weischedel 1980, Kwasney 1981, and Weischedel 1983), and Carbonell and Hayes (Carbonell 1983).

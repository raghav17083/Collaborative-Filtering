For example it has been used to measure centrality in hyperlinked web pages networks (Brin and Page, 1998; Kleinberg, 1998), lexical networks (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Kurland and Lee, 2005; Kurland and Lee, 2006), and semantic networks (Mihalcea et al., 2004). 
Inspired by the idea of graph based algorithms to collectively rank and select the best candidate, research efforts in the natural language community have applied graph-based approaches on keyword selection (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), text summarization (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea, 2004), word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea et al. , 2004; Mihalcea, 2005), sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2004), and sentence retrieval for question answering (Otterbacher et al. , 2005). 
This method was preferred against other related methods, like the one introduced in (Mihalcea et al., 2004), since it embeds all the available semantic information existing in WordNet, even edges that cross POS, thus offering a richer semantic representation. 
Eigenvector centrality in particular has been successfully applied to many different types of networks, including hyperlinked web pages (Brin and Page, 1998; Kleinberg, 1998), lexical networks (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Kurland and Lee, 2005; Kurland and Lee, 2006), and semantic networks (Mihalcea et al. , 2004). 
Ranking algorithms, such as Kleinbergs HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999) or Googles PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998), have been traditionally and successfully used in Web-link analysis (Brin and Page, 1998), social networks, and more recently in text processing applications (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), (Mihalcea et al. , 2004), (Erkan and Radev, 2004).

Oh and Choi (2002) revise this method by introducing binding, in which many to many correspondences are allowed. 
Many researchers have developed machine transliteration systems that accept a source language term as input and then output its transliteration in a target language (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Goto et al., 2003; Grefenstette et al., 2004; Kang and Kim, 2000; Li et al., 2004; Meng et al., 2001; Oh and Choi, 2002; Oh et al., 2006; Qu and Grefenstette, 2004). 
Oh and Choi (2002) define classes of 138 phonemes and assign various distances between phonemes of different classes. 
This information has been used to get better results (Oh and Choi, 2002). 
Recently, much research has been done on machine transliteration for many language pairs, such as English/Arabic (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002), English/Chinese (Chen et al. , 1998; Lin and Chen, 2002; Wan and Verspoor, 1998), English/Japanese (Knight and Graehl, 1998), and English/Korean (Lee and Choi, 1997; Oh and Choi, 2002).

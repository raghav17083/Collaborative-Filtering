This leads to a good amount of work in this area (Ratnaparkhi et al. , 1994; Berger et al. , 1996; Pietra et al, 1997; Zhou et al. , 2003; Riezler and Vasserman, 2004) In the most basic approach, such as Ratnaparkhi et al. 
PP attachment in a parsing context Prepositional phrase attachment (PP attachment) is the problem of determining the correct attachment site for a PP, conventionally in the form of the noun or verb in a V NP PP structure (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994; Mitchell, 2004). 
7.1 Test Data The test data consists of 3097 examples derived from the manually annotated attachments in the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal data (Ratnaparkhi et al. , 1994) 4 . Each line in the test data consists of a 4-tuple and a target classification: V N 1 P N 2 target . 4 Available at ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/adwait/PPattachData. 
(Ratnaparkhi et al. , 1994) reported that human experts could reach an accuracy of 93%, if cases were given as whole sentences out of context. 
Previous uses of this model include language modeling(Lau et al. , 1993), machine translation(Berger et al. , 1996), prepositional phrase attachment(Ratnaparkhi et al. , 1994), and word morphology(Della Pietra et al. , 1995).

We have already applied the maximum entropy methods(Pietra, Pietra, and Lafferty, 1995; Berger, Pietra, and Pietra, 1996) to this task(Utsuro, Miyata, and Matsumoto, 1997) and are also planning to evaluate the effectiveness of the MDL principle(Rissanen, 1989) when combining with the maximum entropy method.

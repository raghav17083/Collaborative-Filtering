PropBank II annota59 tion (eventuality IDs, coarse-grained sense tags, nominal coreference and selected discourse connectives) is being applied to a small (100K) parallel Chinese/English corpus (Babko-Malaya et al. , 2004).

The rst six papers describe linguistic annotation in four languages: Spanish (Alcantara and Moreno, 2004), English (Miltsakaki et al. , 2004; Babko-Malaya et al. , 2004; Meyers et al. , 2004), Czech (Sgall et al. , 2004) and German(Baumann et al. , 2004).


For example, if one accepts the framework of the Penn Treebank, it is easy to move on to representations of deeper structure as suggested in three papers in this volume (Miltsakaki et al. , 2004; Babko-Malaya et al. , 2004; Meyers et al. , 2004).

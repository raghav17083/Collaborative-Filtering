We also note that the post-2003 TREC task has encountered evaluation problems, because it is difficult to agree on which nuggets should be included in the multi-snippet definitions (Hildebrandt et al. , 2004). 
To this effect, the use of hand-written lexico-syntactic patterns and regular expressions, targeting the genus and possibly the differentia of the question concept, is widespread, whether employed for mining de nitions in English (Liu et al., 2003; Hildebrandt et al., 2004) or other languages such as Japanese (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2004), from local text collections (Xu et al., 2004) or from the Web (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2004; Androutsopoulos and Galanis, 2005). 
Definitional patterns: several heuristic patterns, as introduced at (Hildebrandt et al. , 2004), are added into our final pattern sets, such as c, f. 
2.2 The Pyramid Extension The vital/okay distinction has been identified as a weakness in the TREC nugget-based evaluation methodology (Hildebrandt et al. , 2004; Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2005; Lin and DemnerFushman, 2006). 
Such resources include WordNet (Prager et al., 2001) for  nding the genus of the question concept; large dictionaries such as Merriam Webster, for ready-to-use de nitions (Xu et al., 2004; Hildebrandt et al., 2004); and encyclopedias, for collecting words that are likely to occur in potential de nitions (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2004; Xu et al., 2004).

Under this model, we expect that a scenario S can be considered to contextually entail a passage t, when there exists at least one subquestion q derived from S that textually entails the passage t. We show that by using a state-of-the-art textual entailment system (Hickl et al. , 2006b), we can provide Q/A systems with another mechanism for approximating the inference between questions and relevant answers. 
Similarly in (Hickl et al., 2006), suggestions are made to users in the form of predictive question and answer pairs (known as QUABs) which are either generated automatically from the set of documents returned for a query (using techniques first described in (Harabagiu et al., 2005), or are selected from a large database of questions-answer pairs created offline (prior to a dialogue) by human annotators. 
3 Recognizing Textual Entailment Recent work in computational semantics (Haghighi et al. , 2005; Hickl et al. , 2006b; MacCartney et al. , 2006) has demonstrated the viability of supervised machine learning-based approaches to the recognition of textual entailment (TE). 
Following work in (Hickl et al. , 2004), we believe complex questions can be answered in one of two ways: either by (1) using techniques (similar to the ones proposed in (Harabagiu et al. , 2006)) for automatically decomposing complex questions into sets of informationally-simpler questions, or by (2) using a multi-document summarization (MDS) system (such as the one described in (Lacatusu et al. , 2006)) in order to assemble a ranked list of passages which contain information that is potentially relevant to the users question. 
While these approaches have not incorporated the forms of structured world knowledge featured in many logic-based TE systems, classi cation-based approaches have been consistently among the top-performing systems in both the 2005 and 2006 PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenges (Dagan et al. , 2005), with the best systems (such as (Hickl et al. , 2006b)) correctly identifying instances of textual entailment more than 75% of the time.

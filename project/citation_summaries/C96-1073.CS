1 Introduction It is well known that Higher-Order Unification (HOU) can be used to construct the semantics of Natural Language: (Dalrymple et al. , 1991) henceforth, DSP show that it allows a treatment of VPEllipsis which successfully captures the interaction of VPE with quantification and nominal anaphora; (Pulman, 1995; Gardent and Kohlhase, 1996) use HOU to model the interpretation of focus and its interaction with focus sensitive operators, adverbial quantifiers and second occurrence expressions; (Gardent et al. , 1996) shows that HOU yields a simple but precise treatment of corrections; Finally, (Pinkal, 1995) uses linear HOU to reconstruct underspecified semantic representations. 
3 For this case, and for many other types of restrictions currently handled by conditions, more elegant solutions are available using the "sorted" and "colored" versions of higher-order unification developed by Michael Kohlhase and colleagues (Gardent and Kohlhase 1996b, 1997; Gardent Kohlhase, and van Leusen 1996; Gardent, Kohlhase, and Konrad 1999). 
A treatment for ellipsis interpretation which uses a form of higher-order unification has been proposed in (Dalrymple, Shieber, and Pereira, 1991) and extended to other kinds of parallel constructions by (Gardent, Kohlhase, and van Leusen, 1996; Gardent and Kohlhase, 1996). 
For a proposal on how to solve this over-generation problem, see (Gardent and Kohlhase, 1996b; Gardent et al. , 1999).

2.1 Two-stages Comparable Corpora-based Approach The proposed two-stages approach on bilingual terminology acquisition and disambiguation from comparable corpora (Sadat et al. , 2003) is described as follows: Bilingual terminology acquisition from source language to target language to yield a first translation model, represented by similarity vectors SIMS!T. Bilingual terminology acquisition from target language to source language to yield a second translation model, represented by similarity vectors SIMT!S. Merge the first and second models to yield a twostages translation model, based on bi-directional comparable corpora and represented by similarity vectors SIM(S$T . We follow strategies of previous researches (Dejean et al. , 2002; Fung, 2000; Rapp, 1999) for the first and second models and propose a merging and disambiguation process for the two-stages translation model. 
Moreover, non-aligned comparable corpora have been given a special interest in bilingual terminology acquisition and lexical resources enrichment (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Dejean et al. , 2002; Diab and Finch, 2000; Fung, 2000; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Nakagawa, 2000; Peters and Picchi, 1995; Rapp, 1999; Shahzad and al. , 1999; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996). 
In appendix A we show how this method generalizes over the probabilistic approach presented in (Dejean et al. , 2002). 
The proposed two-stages approach for the acquisition, disambiguation and selection of bilingual terminology is described as follows: Bilingual terminology acquisition from source language to target language to yield a first translation model, represented by similarity SIMS!T. Bilingual terminology acquisition from target language to source language to yield a second translation model, represented by similarity SIMT!S. Merge the first and second models to yield a two-stages translation model, based on bidirectional comparable corpora and represented by similarity SIMS$T . We follow strategies of previous researches (Dejean et al. , 2002; Fung, 2000; Rapp, 1999) for the first and second translation models and propose a merging strategy for the two-stages translation model (Sadat et al. , 2003). 
In addition, non-aligned comparable corpora have been given a special interest in bilingual terminology acquisition and lexical resources enrichment (Dejean et al. , 2002; Fung, 2000; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1999).

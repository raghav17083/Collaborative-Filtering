C00-2090:1	29:139	This approach has also been followed by Gale & Church (1993) for their alignment algorithm, with six operations.

A94-1013:2	9:173	1 Introduction Labeling of sentence boundaries is a necessary prerequisite for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including part-of-speech tagging (Church, 1988), (Cutting et al. , 1991), and sentence alignment (Gale and Church, 1993), (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993).
---------------------------------------------------
J97-2004:3	18:485	E-mail: ksj@volans.cs.scu.edu.tw; jschang@cs.nthu.edu.tw (~) 1997 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 In addition to machine translation, many applications for aligned corpora have been suggested, including machine-aided translation (Shemtov 1993), translation assessment and critiquing tools (Isabelle 1992; des Tombe and Armstrong-Warwick 1993; Macklovitch 1994), text generation (Smadja 1992; Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou 1996), bilingual lexicography (Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990; Church and Gale 1991; Daille, Gaussier, and Lange 1994; Kupiec 1993; van der Eijk 1993; Li 1994; Wu and Xia 1994), and word-sense disambiguation (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Chang, Chen, Sheng, and Ker 1996).
---------------------------------------------------
J97-2004:4	35:485	Dagan, Church, and Gale (1993) observe that reliably distinguishing sentence boundaries for a noisy bilingual text scanned by an OCR device is quite difficult.
---------------------------------------------------
J97-2004:5	13:485	For MT and other purposes, many methods have been proposed for sentence alignment of the Hansards, an English-French corpus of Canadian parliamentary debates (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Gale and Church 1991a; Sirnard, Foster, and Isabelle 1992; Chen 1993; Gale and Church 1993), and for other language pairs, including English-German, EnglishChinese, and English-Japanese (Kay and ROscheisen 1993; Church, Dagan, Gale, Fung, Helfman, and Satish 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994; Wu 1994).
---------------------------------------------------
P98-1042:6	13:174	Various methods have been developed for sentence alignment which we can categorise as either lexical such as (Chen, 1993), based on a large-scale bilingual lexicon; statistical such as (Brown et al. , 1991) (Church, 1993)(Gale and Church, 1903)(Kay and RSsheheisen, 1993), based on distributional regularities of words or byte-length ratios and possibly inducing a bilingual lexicon as a by-product, or hybrid such as (Utsuro et al. , 1994) (Wu, 1994), based on some combination of the other two.
---------------------------------------------------
C04-1154:7	12:166	(Kay and Roscheisen, 1993; Gale & Church, 1993), no methods exist for aligning non-isomorphic phrasestructure (PS) tree fragments at sub-sentential level for use in MT.
---------------------------------------------------
P95-1032:8	12:188	However, sentence alignment (Brown et al. 1991; Kay & RSscheisen 1993; Gale & Church 1993; Church 1993; Chen 1993; Wu 1994) is not always practical when corpora have unclear sentence boundaries or with noisy text segments present in only one language.
---------------------------------------------------
P95-1032:9	57:188	Dynamic Time Warping, a pattern recognition technique, was proposed as a good way to match these 1This was found to be the case in the Japanese translation of the AWK manual (Church et al. 1993).
---------------------------------------------------
P95-1032:10	105:188	Previous alignment methods we used such as Church (1993); Fung & Church (1994); Fung & McKeown (1994) would bin the anchor points into continuous blocks for a rough alignment.
---------------------------------------------------
W04-1121:11	12:170	(Church, Kenneth W, 1993; Chen, Stanley, 1993) proposed some methods to resolve the problem in noisy bilingual texts.
---------------------------------------------------
W04-1121:12	10:170	1 Introduction There have been a number of papers on aligning parallel texts at the sentence level in the last century, e.g., (Brown et al. 1991; Gale and Church, 1993; Simard et al. 1992; Wu DeKai 1994).
---------------------------------------------------
P98-1074:13	4:126	1 Introduction Early works, (Gale and Church, 1993; Brown et al. , 1993), and to a certain extent (Kay and R6scheisen, 1993), presented methods to ex~.:'~.ct bi'_.'i~gua!
---------------------------------------------------
P99-1067:14	96:174	They were based on mutual information (Church & Hanks, 1989), conditional probabilities (Rapp, 1996), or on some standard statistical tests, such as the chi-square test or the loglikelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993).
---------------------------------------------------
P99-1067:15	8:174	Many studies show that for nicely parallel corpora high accuracy rates of up to 99% can be achieved for both sentence and word alignment (Gale & Church, 1993; Kay & R/Sscheisen, 1993).
---------------------------------------------------
P99-1043:16	62:167	Co-occurrence information between neighboring words and words in the same sentence has been used in phrase extraction (Smadja, 1993; Fung and Wu, 1994), phrasal translation (Smadja et al. , 1996; Kupiec, 1993; Wu, 1995; Dagan and Church, 1994), target word selection (Liu and Li, 1997; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996), domain word translation (Fung and Lo, 1998; Fung, 1998), sense disambiguation (Brown et al. , 1991; Dagan et al. , 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994; Gale et al. , 1992a; Gale et al. , 1992b; Gale et al. , 1992c; Shiitze, 1992; Gale et al. , 1993; Yarowsky, 1995), and even recently for query translation in cross-language IR as well (Ballesteros and Croft, 1998).
---------------------------------------------------
P99-1043:17	77:167	Mutual information is a good measure of the co-occurrence relationship between two words (Gale and Church, 1993).
---------------------------------------------------
P06-2092:18	32:152	2.1 Sentence Alignment Sentence alignment strategies fall roughly into three categories: length-based approaches (Gale and Church, 1991; Gale and Church, 1993) are based on the assumption that the length proportions of a sentence and its translation are roughly the same.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-2092:19	10:152	The alignment of sentences can be done sufficiently well using cues such as sentence length (Gale and Church, 1993) or cognates (Simard et al. , 1992).
---------------------------------------------------
P06-2092:20	34:152	The third approach uses bilingual lexical information, e.g. estimated from the corpus (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993; Fung and Church, 1994; Fung and McKeown, 1994).
---------------------------------------------------
A00-2002:21	8:182	Yet, even between languages as close as English and French, there is a 10% mismatch in number of sentences -what is said in two sentences in one language is said in only one, or in three, in the other (Gale and Church, 1993).
---------------------------------------------------
W04-1408:22	43:277	Alignment at the sentence level is achieved by applying the Gale-Church algorithm (Gale and Church 1993).
---------------------------------------------------
C96-1037:23	15:214	The resolution of alignment can vat3, from low to high: section, paragraph, sentence, phrase, and word (Gale and Church 1993; Matsumoto et al. 1993).
---------------------------------------------------
W09-0430:24	59:224	A hybrid approach is presented in (Gale and Church, 1993) whose basic hypothesis is that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences.
---------------------------------------------------
W05-0810:25	20:106	First, we considered single sentences as documents, and tokens as sentences (we define a token as a sequence of characters delimited by 1In our case, the score we seek to globally maximize by dynamic programming is not only taking into account the length criteria described in (Gale and Church, 1993) but also a cognate-based one similar to (Simard et al. , 1992).
---------------------------------------------------
W05-0810:26	17:106	A second pass aligns the sentences in a way similar1 to the algorithm described by Gale and Church (1993), but where the search space is constrained to be close to the one delimited by the word alignment.
---------------------------------------------------
P03-1048:27	42:179	ALGN (alignment-based): We ran a sentence alignment algorithm (Gale and Church, 1993) for each pair of English and Chinese stories.
---------------------------------------------------
W97-0308:28	10:128	We will (borrowing a usage from (Church and Gale, 1993) term this agreement (sub)tree alignment.
---------------------------------------------------
E09-1003:29	116:184	Gale and Church (1993) based their align program on the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences.
---------------------------------------------------
C02-1002:30	24:152	The proper extraction of translation equivalents requires special pre-processing:  sentence alignment; we used a slightly modified version of CharAlign described by Gale and Church (1993).
---------------------------------------------------
C02-1002:31	23:152	The assumptions we made were the following:  a lexical token in one half of the translation unit (TU) corresponds to at most one non-empty lexical unit in the other half of the TU; this is the 1:1 mapping assumption which underlines the work of many other researchers (Ahrenberg et al (2000), Brew and McKelvie (1996), Hiemstra (1996), Kay and Rscheisen (1993), Tiedmann (1998), Melamed (2001) etc);  a polysemous lexical token, if used several times in the same TU, is used with the same meaning; this assumption is explicitly used by Gale and Church (1991), Melamed (2001) and implicitly by all the previously mentioned authors;  a lexical token in one part of a TU can be aligned to a lexical token in the other part of the TU only if the two tokens have compatible types (part-of-speech); in most cases, compatibility reduces to the same POS, but it is also possible to define other compatibility mappings (e.g. participles or gerunds in English are quite often translated as adjectives or nouns in Romanian and vice-versa);  although the word order is not an invariant of translation, it is not random either (Ahrenberg et al (2000)); when two or more candidate translation pairs are equally scored, the one containing tokens which are closer in relative position are preferred.
---------------------------------------------------
W03-1503:32	18:189	Sentential alignment (Brown et al. , 1991; Gale and Church, 1993; Kay and Roscheisen, 1993; Utsuro et al. , 1994; Haruno and Yamazaki, 1996) is commonly used as a starting point for finding the translations of words or expressions from bilingual corpora.
---------------------------------------------------
C94-2175:33	134:134	(1991) inight be better than tile character-b~ed method in Gale and Church (1993).
---------------------------------------------------
C94-2175:34	67:134	Dynamic programming is applied to bilingual sentence alignment in most of previous works (Brown et al. , 1991; Gate and Church, 1993; Chen, 1993).
---------------------------------------------------
C94-2175:35	132:134	(1991) and Gale and Church (1993).
---------------------------------------------------
C94-2175:36	8:134	(1990)), finding character-level / word-level / phrase-level correspondences from bilingual texts (e.g. Gale and Church (1991), Church (1993), and Kupiec (1993)), and word sense disambiguation for MT (e.g. Dagan, Itai and Schwall (1991)).
---------------------------------------------------
C94-2175:37	10:134	For example, sentence alignment of bilingual texts are performed just by measuring sentence lengths in words or in characters (Brown et al. , 1991; Gale and Church, 1993), or by statistically estimating word level correspondences (Chen, 1993; Kay and RSscheisen, 1993).
---------------------------------------------------
C94-2175:38	7:134	The statistical approach involves the following: alignment of bilingual texts at the sentence level nsing statistical techniques (e.g. Brown, Lai and Mercer (1991), Gale and Church (1993), Chen (1993), and Kay and RSscheisen (1993)), statistical machine translation models (e.g. Brown, Cooke, Pietra, Pietra et al.
---------------------------------------------------
C94-2175:39	72:134	Let w, and w~ be words in the texts S and T respectively, we define the following frequencies: freq(w~,,wt) = (frequency of wa and wt's co-occurring in a sentence head) f','eq(w,) = (frequency of 'w.~) freq(wt) = (frequency of wt) N (total number of sentence beads) Then, estimation functions of Gale's (Gale and Church, 1991 ) and Kay's (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993) are given a.s below.
---------------------------------------------------
C94-2175:40	46:134	So fitr, we have implemented the following,: sentence ~dignment btLsed-on word correspondence information, word correspondence estimation by cooccnl'rence-ffequency-based methods in GMe mid Church (19.~H) and Kay and R6scheisen (1993), structured Imttehlng of parallel sentences (Matsumoto et a l. , 1993), and case Dame acquisition of Japanese verbs (Utsuro et al. , 1993).
---------------------------------------------------
P98-1069:41	7:117	In the years since the appearance of the first papers on using statistical models for bilingual lexicon compilation and machine translation(Brown et al. , 1993; Brown et al. , 1991; Gale and Church, 1993; Church, 1993; Simard et al. , 1992), large amount of human effort and time has been invested in collecting parallel corpora of translated texts.
---------------------------------------------------
P98-1069:42	103:117	This approach has also been used by (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Gale et al. , 1992; Shiitze, 1992; Gale et al. , 1993; Yarowsky, 1995; Gale and Church, 1Lunar is not an unknown word in English, Yeltsin finds its translation in the 4-th candidate.
---------------------------------------------------
P98-1069:43	105:117	Some of the early statistical terminology translation methods are (Brown et al. , 1993; Wu and Xia, 1994; Dagan and Church, 1994; Gale and Church, 1991; Kupiec, 1993; Smadja et al. , 1996; Kay and RSscheisen, 1993; Fung and Church, 1994; Fung, 1995b).
---------------------------------------------------
J97-2002:44	225:474	13 For example, the sentence alignment algorithm in Gale and Church (1993) allows a distinction between hard and soft boundaries, where soft boundaries are movable by the alignment program.
---------------------------------------------------
J97-2002:45	10:474	The success of most natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, including multilingual sentence alignment algorithms (Kay and R6scheisen 1993; Gale and Church 1993), 1 part-of-speech taggers (Cutting et al. 1991), and parsers, depends on prior knowledge of the location of sentence boundaries.
---------------------------------------------------
J97-2002:46	466:474	For example, combining our system with a fast sentence alignment program such as that of Gale and Church (1993), which performs alignment at a rate of up to 1,000 sentences/minute, would make it possible to rapidly and accurately create a bilingual aligned corpus from raw parallel texts.
---------------------------------------------------
J96-1001:47	58:576	It has been noted in more recent work that length-based alignment programs such as these are problematic for many cases of real world parallel data, such as OCR (Optical Character Recognition) input, in which periods may not be noticeable (Church 1993), or languages where insertions or deletions are common (Shemtov 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994).
---------------------------------------------------
J96-1001:48	53:576	Thus, we draw on work done at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Gale and Church (1991a, 1991b, 1993) and at IBM by Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) on bilingual sentence alignment.
---------------------------------------------------
J96-1001:49	47:576	Related Work The recent availability of large amounts of bilingual data has attracted interest in several areas, including sentence alignment (Gale and Church 1991b; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Simard, Foster and Isabelle 1992; Gale and Church 1993; Chen 1993), word alignment (Gale and Church 1991a; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994; Fung 1995b), alignment of groups of words (Smadja 1992; Kupiec 1993; van der Eijk 1993), and statistical translation (Brown et al. 1993).
---------------------------------------------------
J96-1001:50	56:576	The AT&T group (Gale and Church 1993) defines sentence length by the number of characters in the sentences, while the IBM group (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991) defines sentence length by the number of words in the sentence.
---------------------------------------------------
J96-1001:51	572:576	For example, previous work has addressed low-level tasks such as tagging a free-style corpus with part-of-speech information (Church 1988), aligning a bilingual corpus (Gale and Church 1991b; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991), and producing a list of collocations (Smadja 1993).
---------------------------------------------------
W97-0119:52	7:165	1 Introduction Despite a surge in research using parallel corpora for various machine translation tasks (Brown et al. 1993),(Brown et al. 1991; Gale & Church 1993; Church 1993; Dagan & Church 1994; Simard et al. 1992; Chen 1993; Melamed 1995; Wu & Xia 1994; Wu 1994; Smadja et aI.
---------------------------------------------------
P03-1010:53	51:256	First, we use a method based on CLIR to align Japanese and English articles (Collier et al. , 1998; Matsumoto and Tanaka, 2002) and then a method based on DP matching to align Japanese and English sentences (Gale and Church, 1993; Utsuro et al. , 1994) in these articles.
---------------------------------------------------
P03-1010:54	12:256	We first aligned the articles using a method based on CLIR (Collier et al. , 1998; Matsumoto and Tanaka, 2002) and then aligned the sentences in these articles by using a method based on dynamic programming (DP) matching (Gale and Church, 1993; Utsuro et al. , 1994).
---------------------------------------------------
P03-1010:55	70:256	3.2 Sentence alignment The sentences5 in the aligned Japanese and English articles are aligned by a method based on DP matching (Gale and Church, 1993; Utsuro et al. , 1994).
---------------------------------------------------
W03-0320:56	86:144	For comparison, the Gale and Church (1993) program, which did not make use of additional anchors, had poorer results over our corpus.
---------------------------------------------------
W03-0320:57	79:144	All alignments that occurred in the first two sentences of each paragraph were marked as hard boundaries for the Gale and Church (1993) program as provided in their paper.
---------------------------------------------------
W03-0320:58	11:144	Sentences have been aligned using the length-based dynamic programming approach of Gale and Church (1993) enhanced with a small number of lexical and non-alphabetic anchors.
---------------------------------------------------
W03-0320:59	43:144	3 Sentence Alignment 3.1 Sentence Alignment Approach The algorithm used to align English-Inuktitut sentences is an extension of that presented in Gale and Church (1993).
---------------------------------------------------
W03-0320:60	57:144	Following a suggestion in Gale and Church (1993), the alignment was aided by the use of additional anchors that were available for the language pair.
---------------------------------------------------
P96-1018:61	170:249	Our evaluation focuses on much smaller texts than those used in other study(Brown and others, 1993; Gale and Church, 1993; Wu, 1994; Fung, 1995; Kay and Roscheisen, 1993) because our main targets are well-separated articles.
---------------------------------------------------
P96-1018:62	28:249	(Church, 1993) employed n-grams shared by two languages.
---------------------------------------------------
P96-1018:63	11:249	1 Introduction Corpus-based approaches based on bilingual texts are promising for various applications(i.e. , lexical knowledge extraction (Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al. , 1993; Smadja et al. , 1996; Dagan and Church, 1994; Kumano and Hirakawa, 1994; Haruno et al. , 1996), machine translation (Brown and others, 1993; Sato and Nagao, 1990; Kaji et al. , 1992) and information retrieval (Sato, 1992)).
---------------------------------------------------
P96-1018:64	14:249	One of the major approaches is based on the statistics of simple features such as sentence length in words (Brown and others, 1991) or in characters (Gale and Church, 1993).
---------------------------------------------------
P96-1018:65	242:249	(Church, 1993) proposed char_align that makes use of n-grams shared by two languages.
---------------------------------------------------
W06-3111:66	14:194	Previous investigations can be found in works such as (Gale and Church, 1993) and (Ma, 2006).
---------------------------------------------------
C94-2178:67	22:102	These tables were computed from a small fragment of the Canadian Hansards that has been used in a number of other studies: Church (1993) and Simard et al (1992).
---------------------------------------------------
C94-2178:68	90:102	Using a scatter plot technique developed by Church and Helfman (1993) called dotplot, we can visulize the alignment, as illustrated in Figure 1.
---------------------------------------------------
C94-2178:69	10:102	In previous work (Church et al, 1993), we have reported some preliminary success in aligning the English and Japanese versions of the AWK manual (Aho, Kernighan, Weinberger (1980)), using charalign (Church, 1993), a method that looks for character sequences that are the same in both the source and target.
---------------------------------------------------
C94-2178:70	7:102	Motivation There have been quite a number of recent papers on parallel text: Brown et al (1990, 1991, 1993), Chen (1993), Church (1993), Church et al (1993), Dagan et al (1993), Gale and Church (1991, 1993), Isabelle (1992), Kay and Rgsenschein (1993), Klavans and Tzoukermann (1990), Kupiec (1993), Matsumoto (1991), Ogden and Gonzales (1993), Shemtov (1993), Simard et al (1992), WarwickArmstrong and Russell (1990), Wu (to appear).
---------------------------------------------------
C94-2178:71	102:102	Currently, word_align depends on charalign (Church, 1993) to generate a starting point, which limits its applicability to European languages since char_align was designed for language pairs that share a common alphabet.
---------------------------------------------------
C94-2178:72	85:102	Results This algorithm was applied to a fragment of the Canadian Hansards that has been used in a number of other studies: Church (1993) and Simard et al (1992).

Even if speaker mentions are not annotated (as in System A), it is still beneficial to make use of it, e.g., by first identifying them automatically as in System B. 4 Related Work There is a large body of literature for coreference resolution based on machine learning (Kehler, 1997; Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Yang et al., 2008; Luo et al., 2004) approach. 
More recently, the problem has been tackled using statistics-based (e.g., Bean and Riloff 1999; Bergsma et al 2008) and learning-based (e.g. Evans 2001; Ng and Cardie 2002a; Ng 2004; Yang et al 2005; Denis and Balbridge 2007) methods. 
Although many existing machine learning approaches to coreference resolution have performed reasonably well without explicit anaphoricity determination (e.g., Soon et al 2001; Ng and Cardie 2002b; Strube and Muller 2003; Yang et al 2003, 2008), anaphoricity determination has been studied fairly extensively in the literature, given the potential usefulness of NP anaphoricity in coreference resolution. 
2 Related Work Given its potential usefulness in coreference resolution, anaphoricity determination has been studied fairly extensively in the literature and can be classified into three categories: heuristic rule-based (e.g. Paice and Husk 1987; Lappin and Leass 1994; Kennedy and Boguraev 1996; Denber 1998; Vieira and Poesio 2000), statistics-based (e.g., Bean and Riloff 1999; Cherry and Bergsma 2005; Bergsma et al 2008) and learning-based (e.g. Evans 2001; Ng and Cardie 2002a; Ng 2004; Yang et al 2005; Denis and Balbridge 2007). 
Motivated by previous work (Luo et al., 2004; Culotta et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2008), we create cluster-level features from mention-pair features using four predicates: NONE, MOST-FALSE, MOST-TRUE, and ALL.

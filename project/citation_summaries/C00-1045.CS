This formulation doesnt address the real problem for a theory of pronominalization or, more generally, 353 Poesio et al. Centering: A Parametric Theory of NP form decision, which is to decide when a discourse entity should be realized as a pronoun (Henschel, Cheng, and Poesio 2000). 
These results, and the annotated corpus, were used in the development of both symbolic and statistical natural language generation algorithms for sentence planning (Poesio, 2000a; Henschel et al. , 2000; Cheng et al. , 2001), aggregation (Cheng, 2001) and text planning (Karamanis, 2003). 
While many NLG researchers have attempted to transfer the ideas of Centering Theory to generation (Not, 1996; Yeh and Mellish, 1997; McCoy and Strube, 1999; Henschel et al. , 2000; Kibble and Power, 2000), there has yet been no substantial return contribution to the field of anaphora resolution. 
AF Checking algorithms semiautomatically: Other researchers opt instead to annotate a corpus for pronominalization and their antecedents as well as the pronoun forms that should occur, and then simulate a pronominalization algorithm on the marked-up text (Henschel et al. , 2000). 
The GNOME corpus has been used to study salience, particularly as formalized in Centering theory (Poesio et al. , 2004c), to develop statistical models of natural language generation (e.g. , (Poesio, 2000a; Henschel et al. , 2000; Cheng et al. , 2001; Cheng, 2001; Karamanis, 2003)) and to evaluate anaphora resolution systems, with a special focus on the resolution of bridging references (Poesio, 2003; Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov, 2004; Poesio et al. , 2004b).

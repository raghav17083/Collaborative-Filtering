(Sparck Jones 1994, page 107) Putting greater emphasis on the extrinsic perspective in HLT research will result in improved checks and balances for the evaluation methods we apply; it will enable us to 7 Some examples: (i) The drug cholestyramine successfuly reduces blood cholesterol levels, but was found to have no impact on overall mortality rate (Le Fanu 1999, page 341); (ii) cardiac ac/decleration and raised blood acidity were thought to be indicators of an increased risk of cerebral palsy, but the introduction of foetal monitoring had no effect on the incidence of cerebral palsy, which remained constant (Le Fanu 1999, pages 255258); (iii) commonly used in adverts by nancial institutions and as the basis for investor decisions, past performance has been shown not to be a reliable indicator of the future performance of mutual funds (Allen et al. 2003); (iv) total harmonic distortion was thought to be an overall indicator of amplier quality until the 1970s when, following technological improvements in audio production, it was found not to correlate with expert listeners assessments at improved levels.


Another common distinction is about evaluation methods: intrinsic evaluations assess properties of systems in their own right, for example, comparing their outputs to reference outputs in a corpus, whereas extrinsic evaluations assess the effect of a system on something that is external to it, for example, the effect on human performance at a given task or the value added to an application (Sparck Jones 1994).

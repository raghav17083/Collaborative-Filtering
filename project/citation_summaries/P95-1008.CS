As Keller (1995) points out, the meaning of a node depends on the global context, and a node thus really denotes a function from global contexts to partial functions from paths to values.


Keller (1995) effectively replaces our 1989 presentation of a semantics for DATR and his treatment is general enough to cover descriptor sequences.


If there had been no definition for < >, then none of these example paths would have 18 For formal discussion of the semantics of the DATR default mechanism, see Keller (1995).


A denotational semantics for DATR that covers all of the major constructs has been presented in (Keller, 1995).

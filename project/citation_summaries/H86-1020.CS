(Vijayashanker, Joshi, 1986) Given a TAG G and an input string aza2an, n > 1, the entries in A will be nodes of the trees of G. We say, that a node m (= < 0, node index, label >) E A(i,j, k, l) iff m is a node in a derived tree 7 and the subtree of 7 rooted at m has a yield given by either ai+lajXak+lal (where X is the footnode of r/, j < k) or ai+l  az (when j = k).

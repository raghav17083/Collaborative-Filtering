3 Alternative Interpretation of Logical Metonymy The approach of Lapata and Lascarides (2003) produces a list of non-disambiguated verbs, essentially just strings, representing possible interpretations of a metonymic phrase. 
5 Automatic Acquisition of the Argument-Predicate Relations In line with (Lapata and Lascarides, 2003), our approach to extraction of argument-predicate (AP) relations is based on two assumptions: A1: If predicates are highly predictable from the semantics of their arguments then they can be omitted in a discourse; A2: If a predicate frequently takes a word as an argument then it is highly predictable from the semantics of this word. 
4 Extracting Ambiguous Interpretations 4.1 Parameter Estimation We used the method developed by Lapata and Lascarides (2003) to create the initial list of nondisambiguated interpretations. 
8.2 The Effect of the Metonymic Verb By analysing phrases from the dataset of Lapata and Lascarides (2003) we found that different metonymic verbs have different effect on the interpretation of logical metonymy. 
In line with (Lapata and Lascarides, 2003) our approach is based on the assumption that predicates are omitted in a discourse when they are highly predictable from the semantics of their arguments.

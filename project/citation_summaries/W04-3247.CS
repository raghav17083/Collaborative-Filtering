(3) LexPageRank: The method first constructs a sentence connectivity graph based on cosine similarity and then selects important sentences based on the concept of eigenvector centrality (Erkan and Radev, 2004). 
Most recently, graph-based ranking methods, including TextRank ((Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004, 2005) and LexPageRank (ErKan and Radev, 2004) have been proposed for document summarization. 
Ranking algorithms, such as Kleinbergs HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999) or Googles PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998), have been traditionally and successfully used in Web-link analysis (Brin and Page, 1998), social networks, and more recently in text processing applications (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), (Mihalcea et al. , 2004), (Erkan and Radev, 2004). 
LexPageRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004) is an approach for computing sentence importance based on the concept of eigenvector centrality. 
Recently, graph-based ranking methods, such as LexPageRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004) and TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004),  1  http://haydn.isi.edu/ROUGE/ have been proposed for multi-document summarization.

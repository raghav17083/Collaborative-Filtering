In the STOP system (Reiter 2000), texts are constrained to fit a certain length. 
There is not space here to explore the large issue of surface-level constraints and their consequences for NLG architecture, but see [Reiter, 2000] for some discussion. 
While many speech recognition and natural-language understanding applications can be tested by comparing their output to a human-produced gold standard' (for example, speech recogniser output can be compared to a human transcription of a speech signal), this to date has been harder to do in NLG, especially in applications such as STOP where there are no human experts (Reiter et al. , 2000) (there are many experts on personalised oral communication with smokers, but none on personalised written communication, because no one currently writes personalised letters to smokers). 
Both outputs were produced by  1 The STOP system identifies the problem as a bin-packing problem but then describes its mechanism using terms common to greedy algorithms (Reiter, 2000). 
One complicating factor is that the pun criteria are largely surface constraints which apply to what, in a conventional pipeline NLG architecture [Reiter and Dale, 2000], would be the final output of the generator.

Another important direction is classifying sentences as subjective or objective, and classifying subjective sentences or clauses as positive or negative (Wiebe et al, 1999; Wiebe and Wilson, 2002, Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Wilson et al, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Riloff and Wiebe, 2005; Gamon et al 2005; McDonald et al, 2007). 
6.2 Agreement Among Taggers There are techniques for analyzing agreement when annotations involve segment boundaries (Litman and Passonneau, 1995;; Marcu et al. , 1999), but our focus in this paper is on words. 
 hierarchical: annotation of features at multiple levels, building upon lower levels of analysis at the clause or sentence level (Moser and Moore, 1995; Marcu, et al. 1999)  document-level: broad characterization of document structure such as identification of topical segments (Hearst, 1997), linking of large text segments via specific relations (Ferrari, 1998; Rebeyrolle, 2000), or defining text objects with a text architecture (Pery-Woodley and Rebeyrolle, 1998). 
For an SVM-based approach, see (Drucker et al 1999). 
There are certainly lexical items that are statistically correlated with the obKnown Subjective Vocabulary HighPrecision Objective Sentence Classifier (HPObj) HighPrecision Subjective Sentence Classifier (HPSubj) Unannotated Text Collection unlabeled sentences unlabeled sentences unlabeled sentences Patternbased Subjective Sentence Classifier Extraction Pattern Learner subjective sentences subjective sentences objective sentences subjective patterns subjective patterns Figure 1: Bootstrapping Process jective class (examples are cardinal numbers (Wiebe et al. , 1999), and words such as per, case, market, and total), but the presence of such clues does not readily lead to high precision objective classification.

Second, because the automatically generated segments make up for the lack of explicit orthographic cues (e.g. , story and paragraph breaks) in conversational speech, dialogue segmentation is useful in many spoken language understanding tasks, including anaphora resolution (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), information retrieval (e.g. , as input for the TREC Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) task), and summarization (Zechner and Waibel, 2000).


These include silence, overlap rate, speaker activity change (Galley et al. , 2003), and cross-speaker linking information, such as adjacency pairs (Zechner and Waibel, 2000).

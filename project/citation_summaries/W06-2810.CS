Furthermore, additional parallel sentences may be extracted from some of the other comparable articles using techniques along the lines of (Adafre and de Rijke, 2006). 
Other language processing tasks with recently proposed solutions relying on Wikipedia are co-reference resolution using Wikipedia-based measures of word similarity (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006), enhanced text classification using encyclopedic knowledge (Gabrilovich 202 and Markovitch, 2006), and the construction of comparable corpora using the multilingual editions of Wikipedia (Adafre and de Rijke, 2006).

To date research in Computational Linguistics using Wikipedia includes: Automatic derivation of taxonomy information (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006; Suchanek et al. , 2007; Zesch and Gurevych, 2007; Ponzetto, 2007); automatic recognition of pairs of similar sentences in two languages (Adafre and de Rijke, 2006); corpus mining (Rcurrency1udiger Gleim and Alexander Mehler and Matthias Dehmer, 2007), Named Entity Recognition (Toral and noz, 2007; Bunescu and Pasca, 2007) and relation extraction (Nguyen et al. , 2007). 
Adafre and Rijke (2006) developed a technique to identify similar text across multiple languages in wikipedia using page contentbased features.

Next along the spectrum of orthographic similarBarcelona, July 2004 Association for Computations Linguistics ACL Special Interest Group on Computational Phonology (SIGPHON) Proceedings of the Workshop of the ity bias is the work of Schone and Jurafsky (2000), who first acquire a list of pairs of potential morphological variants (PPMVs) using an orthographic similarity technique due to Gaussier (1999), in which pairs of words from a corpus vocabulary with the same initial string are identified. 
Gaussier (1999) induces derivational morphology using an inflectional lexicon which includes part of speech information. 
3 Related Work Most previous work in unsupervised learning of morphology has focused on learning the division between roots and suffixes (e.g. , Sproat, 1992; Gaussier, 1999; Djean, 1996; Goldsmith, 2001). 
Previous morphology induction approaches (Goldsmith, 1997, 2000; D4Jean, 1998; Gaussier, 1999) have focused on inflectional languages and have used statistics of hypothesized stems and affixes to choose which affixes to consider legitimate.

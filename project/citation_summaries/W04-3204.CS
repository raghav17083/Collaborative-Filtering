A first set of methods consists of algorithms that generate sense annotated data using words semantically related to a given ambiguous word (Leacock et al. , 1998; Mihalcea and Moldovan, 1999; Agirre and Martinez, 2004). 
In addition, supervised techniques may not yield reliable results when the distributions of the semantic classes are different in the training and test datasets (Agirre and Martinez, 2004; Koeling et al., 2005). 
More recently, the idea has been used to automatically create sense tagged corpora (Mihalcea, 2002; Agirre and Martinez, 2004) . These methods queried large corpora with relatives rather than with the context. 
It also suggests that using the Wikipedia-based sense tagged corpus to disambiguate words in the SENSEVAL data or viceversa would require a change in the distribution of senses as previously done in (Agirre and Martinez, 2004). 
3 Experimental Settings 3.1 Training We applied the Vector Space Model (VSM) algorithm on the two different kinds of sense examples (i.e. , dictionary translated ones vs. MT software translated ones), as it has been shown to perform well with the features described below (Agirre and Martinez, 2004a).

Brute-force parsing models such as the primordial soup algorithm (Janssen et al. , 1992), at first sight, exhibit a vast potential for parallel execution, since the central operation of building a structure from two independent parts (in our application, e.g., the combination of a head and a single modifier) apparently does not require any centr,'dized control.

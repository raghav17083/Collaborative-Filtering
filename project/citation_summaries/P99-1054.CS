The leftfactorization transform that we use is identical to what is called right binarization in Roark and Johnson (1999). 
However, the properness condition for PDAs has been heavily exploited in parsing applications, in doing incremental left-to-right probability computation for beam search (Roark and Johnson, 1999; Manning and Carpenter, 2000), and more generally in integration with other linear probabilistic models. 
It; is straightforward to detine a 14o-1 tree l;ransform TL mapping parse trees of G into parse trees of dL (G) (.Johnson, 1998a; Roark and Johnson, 1999). 
(Chanfiak et al. , 1998) use a non-incremental procedure, (Roark and Johnson, 1999) use a look-ahead of one word. 
For example, (Sornlertlamvanich et al. , 1999) and (Roark and Johnson, 1999) have shown that a probability distribution that can be obtained by training the probabilities of a CFG on the basis of a corpus can be less accurate than the probability distribution obtained by training the probabilities of a PDA constructed by a particular parsing strategy, on the basis of the same corpus.

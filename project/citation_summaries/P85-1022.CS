o This chart may contain ambiguities which the ATN is extended to cope with Since the ATN aims at the con~3t~'uct.lo~-~ of funotional dependencies (an argum~nt/nlodifi~r head structux'e)which is greatly eased by knowing the head /Proudlan and Pollard 1985/~ we decided to nee head-driven analysis :in "th~ ATNo German Ms basically a sub, eat-oh.Jest .~ verb (SOV) language, that means the head of a phrase comes last wi~h few exc~ptJ.ons, Th_;~:;e exceptions are : NPs may have posl;modlfi<-~rs (~enltive NP:~,, PPs, zslative clauses)~ J,~.


The ~enmntic,zontent is given by a ' semantic' prediea't~ and the functional dependencies and meanings of its arguments, and further red, frictions by modifiers (if any) . The very idea of rep~;esenting semantic dependencies in form of case frame~ goes back to tile work of Fillmore /1968/, whereas ideas ol~ the additional syntactic and functional structure we use can be traced back to Chomsky',a /1981/ Theta--rules and Bresnan' S /1982/ functional structures and in the A:ctificlal Intelligence paradigm -to the work of Ct-eary and Pollard /1985/o The easofx'ames in DB-DIALOG consist of sever:el parted' %'lie head predicate, a SELF-,~ loi for prope~ ~eferencing, so-called VALENCY slots containing functional dependencies (or deep cases ), e MOD slot containing modifiers, a DETERMINER slot for NPs, and SYNTAX and CATEGORY slots containing various s~ntactic information VALI~NCY slots in turn consist of:  .an identifier a syntactic restriction (SYN) a semantic ~estrietion (SEM) oa filler (VALUE) Ce~of~'am~s are instantiated, from the lexicon ai~d Infox',~iation is added during the analysis ~:~f ~'abphza~eso To do so the~e is at least o~:~ so.-oalled "meaning" attached to the ie~:Lc;al entry of each verb,  noun and ~C\]t:~c'tive.

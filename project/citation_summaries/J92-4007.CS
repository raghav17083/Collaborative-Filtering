The sometimes competing informational and intentional roles of discourse segments have been at the centre of the debate over the nucleus-satellite distinction (Moore and Pollack, 1992; Moser and Moore, 1996; Bateman and Rondhius, 1997); the accessibility of discourse segments on the right frontier of a discourse structure is a phenomenon that has already been discussed by several researchers (Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993). 
Moore and Pollack 1992). 
However, the results are trees of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1986), and the classi ers rely on well-formedness constraints on RST trees which are too restrictive (Moore and Pollack, 1992). 
Recent work (Moore and Paris 1993; Moore and Pollack 1992) has argued that to account for explanation dialogues, it is necessary to independently model both RST relations and intentions. 
Moore and Pollack (1992), Moser and Moore (1996), and Reichman (1985) argue that trees are insufficient for representing informational, intentional, and attentional discourse structure.

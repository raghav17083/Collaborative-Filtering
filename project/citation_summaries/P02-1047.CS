For such cases, unsupervised approaches have been developed for predicting relations, by using sentences containing discourse connectives as training data (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Lapata and Lascarides, 2004). 
The effectiveness of these features for recognition of discourse relations has been previously shown by Marcu and Echihabi (2002). 
3 The M&E Framework We model two RSRs, Cause and Contrast, adopting the de nitions of Marcu and Echihabi (2002) (henceforth M&E) for their Cause-ExplanationEvidence and Contrast relations, respectively. 
Although this study falls under the general topic of discourse modeling, our work differs from previous attempts to characterize text in terms of domainindependent rhetorical elements (McKeown, 1985; Marcu and Echihabi, 2002). 
Section 7 considers recent efforts to induce effective procedures for automated sense labelling of discourse relations that are not lexically marked (Elwell and Baldridge, 2008; Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Pitler et al., 2009; Wellner and Pustejovsky, 2007; Wellner, 2008).

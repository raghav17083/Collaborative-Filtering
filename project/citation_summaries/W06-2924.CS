Graph-based models of dependency parsing (e.g., McDonald et al., 2006), for example, rely on breaking parsing down into decisions about smaller substructures, and focusing on pairs of words has been used for domain adaptation (Chen et al., 2008) and in memory-based parsing (Canisius et al., 2006). 
c2007 Association for Computational Linguistics A Constraint Satisfaction Approach to Dependency Parsing Sander Canisius ILK / Communication and Information Science Tilburg University, P.O. Box 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, The Netherlands S.V.M.Canisius@uvt.nl Erik Tjong Kim Sang ISLA, University of Amsterdam, Kruislaan 403, NL-1098 SJ Amsterdam, The Netherlands erikt@science.uva.nl Abstract We present an adaptation of constraint satisfaction inference (Canisius et al. , 2006b) for predicting dependency trees. 
Our first intuition about the results from the tests done on all the 10 languages was that the classification task suffered from a highly skewed class distribution since the training instances that correspond to a dependency relation are largely outnumbered by the NO class (Canisius et al. , 2006). 
The method is an adaptation of earlier work using constraint satisfaction techniques for predicting sequential outputs (Canisius et al. , 2006b). 
From the perspective of error correction, we cannot assume that information from the other relations in the sentence is reliable.3 This representation also fits nicely with previous work, both in error detection (see section 2.1) and in dependency parsing (e.g., Canisius et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2008).

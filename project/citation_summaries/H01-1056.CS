Of existing IR systems employing this combination, QCS most resembles the NewsInEssence system (Radev et al. , 2001a) in that both systems can produce multi-document summaries from document sets clustered by topic. 
3 BLEU and N-gram Co-Occurrence To automatically evaluate machine translations the machine translation community recently adopted an n-gram co-occurrence scoring procedure BLEU (Papineni et al. 2001). 
A series of workshops on automatic text summarization (WAS 2000, 2001, 2002), special topic sessions in ACL, COLING, and SIGIR, and government sponsored evaluation efforts in the United States (DUC 2002) and Japan (Fukusima and Okumura 2001) have advanced the technology and produced a couple of experimental online systems (Radev et al. 2001, McKeown et al. 2002). 
Section 3 discusses the IBM BLEU (Papineni et al. 2001) and NIST (2002) n-gram co-occurrence scoring procedures and the application of a similar idea in evaluating summaries. 
4 Other interfaces We will be also showing the Java-MEAD interface (Figure 7) implemented in Nutch (a public-domain search engine from www.nutch.org), an older interface, NewsInEssence (Radev et al. , 2001; Radev et al. , 2002) (Figure 6), as well as the MEAD command-line interface.

For example, frequent words are translated less consistently than rare words (Melamed, 1997). 
Alignment at the word and term level, which is extremely useful for applications such as lexical resource extraction, is still a largely unexplored research area(Melamed, 1997). 
Resnik & Melamed (1997) report that the model produced 494 translation lexicons with 94% precision and 30% recall, when trained on French/English software manuals totaling about 400,000 words. 
More sophisticated applications based on alignment technology have also been the object of recent work, such as the automatic building of bilingual lexical resources (Melamed, 1996; Klavans azld Tzoukermann, 1995), the automatic verification of translations (Macklovitch, 1995), the automatic dictation of translations (Brousseau et al., 1995) and even interactive machine translation (Foster et al., 1997). 
Promising features for classification include part of speech, frequency of co-occurrence, relative word position, and translational entropy (Melamed, 1997).

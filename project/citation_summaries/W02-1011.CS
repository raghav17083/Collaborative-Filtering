The former is a task of identifying positive and negative sentiments from a text which can be a passage, a sentence, a phrase and even a word (Somasundaran et al., 2008; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al., 2005). 
The research of opinion mining began in 1997, the early research results mainly focused on the polarity of opinion words (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 1997) and treated the text-level opinion mining as a classification of either positive or negative on the number of positive or negative opinion words in one text (Turney et al., 2003; Pang et al., 2002; Zagibalov et al., 2008;). 
2 Related Work Supervised machine learning methods including Support Vector Machines (SVM) are often used in sentiment analysis and shown to be very promising (Pang et al., 2002; Matsumoto et al., 2005; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004; Mullen and Collier, 2004; Gamon, 2004). 
SVM has been shown to be useful for text classification tasks (Joachims, 1998), and has previously given good performance in sentiment classification experiments (Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006; Mullen and Collier, 2004; Pang and Lee, 2004; Pang et al., 2002). 
This negation handling is similar to that used in (Das and Chen, 2001; Pang et al. , 2002).

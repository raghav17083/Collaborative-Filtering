Tanev and Magnini (2006) proposed a weaklysupervised method that requires as training data a list of named entities, without context, for each category under consideration. 
Therefore, in the literature, the fine-grained classification task has been approached by adopting weakly supervised (Tanev and Magnini, 2006; Fleischman and Hovy, 2002) or unsupervised methods (Cimiano and Volker, 2005). 
Using unsupervised learning, they obtained slightly worst results than Tanev and Magnini (2006) on the same benchmark. 
Weakly supervised corpus-based methods have utilized noun co-occurrence statistics (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Roark and Charniak, 1998), syntactic information (Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Phillips and Riloff, 2002; Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004; Tanev and Magnini, 2006), and lexico-syntactic contextual patterns (e.g., resides in <location> or moved to <location>) (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002).

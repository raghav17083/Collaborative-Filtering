More specifically, work examining dialogue patterns in collaborative environments has demonstrated that pairs adapt their linguistic patterns based on what they believe their partner can see (Brennan, 2005; Clark & Krych, 2004; Gergle et al. , 2004; Kraut et al. , 2003). 
Yet, a number of discourse-based models of reference primarily rely on linguistic information without regard to the surrounding visual environment (e.g. , see Brennan et al. , 1987; Hobbs, 1978; Poesio et al. , 2004; Strube, 1998; Tetreault, 2005). 
The house has a spoken dialogue system (Mourao et al. , 2004) based on TRIPS architecture (Allen et al. , 2005) where a virtual butler named Ambrosio helps the user in daily tasks that deal with devices and services, through speech commands. 
Thus, their approaches apply to explicit interaction techniques but do not necessarily support more general communication in the presence of shared visual information (e.g. , see Chai et al. , 2005; Huls et al. , 1995; Kehler, 2000). 
Yet, as conversational analysts focused on micro-levels of dialogue such as turntaking, computational linguists uncovered and formalized macro-level dialogue structure and devised well-defined representations of semantics for at least some forms of dialogues (Allen and Perrault, 1980; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Clark, 1996), which have in turn been implemented in spoken dialogue systems (Rich and Sidner, 1998; Allen et al., 2005).

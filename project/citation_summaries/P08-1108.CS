2.1 CoNLL-X Results For direct comparison with the approach by Nivre and McDonald (2008), we present the results on the CoNLL-X corpora (Table 3): MST and MSTMalt are the results achieved by the MST parser and the MST parser using hints from Maltparser, Malt and  0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1  0  5  10  15  20  25  30  35 F-Measure Dependency Length Left-to-Right_DeSR Revision_DeSR Figure 1: English. 
(2007) and Nivre and McDonald (2008) can be seen as methods to combine separately defined models. 
This general idea is akin to the notion of classifier stacking, and in the realm of dependency parsing, Nivre and McDonald (2008) successfully stack classifiers to improve parsing by allow[ing] a model to learn relative to the predictions of the other (p. 951). 
Recently Nivre and McDonald (2008) used the output of one dependency parser to provide features for another. 
baselines, allofthemstate-of-the-artparsersbased on non-arc-factored models: the second order model of McDonald and Pereira (2006), the hybrid model of Nivre and McDonald (2008), which combines a (labeled) transition-based and a graphbased parser, and a refinement of the latter, due to Martins et al.

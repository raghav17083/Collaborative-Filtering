In structural example-based machine translation systems (Grishman, 1994; Meyers et al. , 1998; Watanabe et al. , 2000), examples in the knowledge base are normally annotated with their constituency (Kaji et al. , 1992) or dependency structures (Matsumoto et al. , 1993; Aramaki et al. , 2001; AlAdhaileh et al. , 2002), which allows the corresponding relations between source and target sentences to be established at the structural level. 
(Kaji et al., 1992), (Matsumoto et al., 1993), and (Kitamura and Matsumoto, 1995)). 
More sophisticated "parse-parse-match" procedures postpone ambiguity resolution until the matching stage (Kaji et al. 1992; Matsumoto et al. 1993; Grishman 1994). 
Then the correspondent structures in different languages are aligned (e.g. , Kaji, Kida & Morimoto 1992; Matsumoto et al. 1993; Grishman 1994; Meyers, Yanharber & Grishman 1996; Watanabe, Kurohashi & Aramaki 2000). 
(Sate and Nagao, 1990), (Klawms and Tzoukermann, 1990), (Grishman and Kosaka, 1992), (Kaji et al. , 1992), (Matsumoto et al. , 11993) and (Grishman, 11994)).

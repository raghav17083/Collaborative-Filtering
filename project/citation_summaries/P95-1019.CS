43 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 1 Initial work on this component includes a subsystem that can identify what evidence to present to a user when conflicts arise (Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1995b, 1998) and what information to request when the system cannot rationally decide whether to accept a proposition conveyed by the user (Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1995a, 1998). 
Thus, since a communicated proposition is presumed to be relevant to this plan construction process, the dialogue participants are obligated to communicate as soon as possible any discrepancies in belief about such propositions (Walker and Whittaker 1990; Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1995b) and to enter into a negotiation subdialogue in which they attempt to "square away" (Joshi 1982) their disparate beliefs. 
However there are numerous dialogue strategies that an agent might use, e.g. to gather information, handle errors, or manage the dialogue interaction (Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 1995; Danieli and Gerbino, 1995; Hovy, 1993; McKeown, 1985; Moore and Paris, 1989). 
We call this type of subdialogue an information-sharing subdialogue (Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1995b). 
Further analysis shows that a couple of features distinguish collaborative negotiation from argumentation and noncollaborative negotiation (Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1995c).

This method of co-training has been previously applied to a variety of natural language tasks, such as word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995), lexicon construction for information extraction (Riloff and Jones, 1999), and named entity classification (Collins and Singer, 1999). 
Collins and Singer (1999) opened the possibility of using an unlabeled corpus to classify named entities. 
Several approaches for learning from both labeled and unlabeled data have been proposed (Yarowsky, 1995; Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Collins and Singer, 1999) where the unlabeled data is utilised to boost the performance of the algorithm. 
For this reason, name classification has been studied in solving the named entity extraction task in the NLP and information extraction communities (see, for example, (Collins and Singer, 1999; Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999) and various approaches reported in the MUC conferences (MUC-6, 1995)). 
In (Collins and Singer, 1999) Collins and Singer show that unlabeled data can be used to reduce the level of supervision required for named entity classification.

Few studies describe an implemented automatic analysis of comparatives; however, Friedman [Friedman, 1989] is a notable exception.


Like Bresnan and Pinkham, but unlike Friedmann (1989), we will also regard the comparative clause as in general modifying the comparative head in the main clause, as opposed to treating the two clauses as parallel; we discuss further in Section 4 the reasons behind this decision.


In a computational treatment, this means that the deletion rule has to be "reversed," so as to reconstruct the deleted material from the phrasal remnant: this is the method used in Sager (1981) and Friedmann (1989).


So far, there has been a surprisingly small amount of work done in computational frameworks: the only major attempts known to us that integrate syntactic and semantic processing are those reported in Ballard (1988) and Friedmann (1989).


Friedman (1989) developed one of the first computational treatments of comparative structures.

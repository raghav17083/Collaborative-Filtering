Background Koskenniemi (1983a, 1983b, 1984) proposed a rule-system for describing morphological regularities in a language, depending centrally on the idea of matching two sequences of symbols--a lexical string (made up of the lexical forms of morphemes) and a surface string (the sequence of characters in the normal, inflected, form of the word). 
INTRODUCTION Kimmo Koskenniemi's two-level model (Koskenniemi, 1983, Koskenniemi, 1984) uses finite-state transducers to implement phonological rules. 
BACKGROUND Koskenniemi(1983a,b;1984) proposed a rule-system for describing morphological regularities in a language, depending centrally on the idea of matching two sequences of symbols a lexical string (made up of the lexical forms of morphemes) and a surface string (the sequence of characters in the normal, inflected, form of the word). 
Figure 2: Traditional Kimmo-Style System Architecture 3 History In 1989 and 1990, with colleagues at ALPNET (Beesley, 1989; Beesley, Buckwalter and Newtoil, 1989; Buckwalter, 1990; Beesley, 1990), I built a large two-level morphological analyzer for Arabic using a slightly enhanced implementation of KIMMO-style two-level morphology (Koskenniemi, 1983, 1984; Gajek, 1983; Karttunen, 1983). 
Kimmo Koskenniemi /1983a, 1983b, 1984, 1985/\] (\[5\], \[6\], \[7\], \[8\]) took up this approach and applied a variation of it to some heavily inflected languages, first of all to Finnish.

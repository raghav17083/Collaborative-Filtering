Work reported in Alshawi(1985), Calzolari (1983,1984a,b), Lesk(1986), Michiels(1982), etc. , describe various attempts to decipher and extract information in machine-readable versions of published dictionaries (henceforth: MRDs). 
However, each of these fields requires further decoding and restructuring to provide client programs with easy access to the information they require (see Calzolari (1984) for further discussion). 
Recent work on machine-readable dictionaries offers new and interesting possibilities both for the computerassisted lexicology (see Walker 1984) and for constructing lexical databases derived from the definitions in machine-readable dictionaries and utilized in NLP along with other fields (see Amsler 1982, 1984a; Walker, Amsler 1986, Calzolari 1984a,b). 
However, each of these fields requires further decoding and restructuring to provide client programs with easy access to the information they require (Calzolari (1984) discusses this need). 
The work reported in the present paper is related to work reported by Calzolari (1984a, 1984b) and Calzolari and Picchi(1986).

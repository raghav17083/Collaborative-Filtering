Examples include mining the World-Wide Web for parallel text (Resnik, 1999; Nie et al. , 1999; Ma and Liberman, 1999) and building parallel corpora from comparable corpora such as multilingual collections of news reports. 
These were the same pairs for which human evaluations were carried out by Resnik (1999).11 Note that this is not a matching task; the documents are presented as candidate pairs, and there is no competition among pages for matches in the other language. 
The STRAND Web-Mining Architecture STRAND (Resnik 1998, 1999) is an architecture for structural translation recognition, acquiring natural data. 
To solve the problem of different senses not being distinguishable mentioned in the previous paragraph, we chose a language very distant to English  Chinese, since the more distant two languages are, the more likely that senses are lexicalised differently (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999). 
Grefenstette and Nioche (2000) and Jones and Ghani (2000) use the web to generate corpora for languages where electronic resources are scarce, while Resnik (1999) describes a method for mining the web for bilingual texts.

(Prevost and Steedman, 1993; Hoffman, 1994) represent syntax, semantics and pragmatics in a lexicalized framework, but concentrate on information structure rather than the pragmatics of particular constructions. 
The system produces the types of output shown in (20) and aA complete description of the CCG generator can be found in (Prevost and Steedman, 1993). 
(Prevost and Steedman, 1993; Hoffman, 1994) do represent the division of sentences into theme and rheme, but because they do not model the pragmatics of particular constructions, they plan descriptions in a separate step. 
But CCG-Std cannot handle the generalization of type raising that has been used in accounting for various linguistic phenomena including: coordination and extraction (Steedman, 1985; Dowty, 1988; Steedman, 1996), prosody (Prevost and Steedman, 1993), and quantifier scope (Park, 1995). 
Furthermore, (Shieber et al. , 1990; Shieber and Schabes, 1991; Prevost and Steedman, 1993; Hoffman, 1994) exploit similar benefits of lexicalization and localization.

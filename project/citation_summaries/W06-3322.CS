Supervisedlearningbasedonshallowsyntacticfeatures has also been applied to the biomedical domain, again focusing on protein-protein interactions (Nielsen, 2006; Giuliano et al., 2006).


Finally, a relation extractor based on a maximum entropy model and a set of shallow linguistic features is employed, as described in (Nielsen, 2006).

However, there has been little work on integrating the various aspects of dialogue processing into a unified whole (exceptions are Allen et al. \[1995\] and Young et al. \[1989\]). 
Before context-based predictions can be combined with quantitative non context-based predictions, they must be quantified, it was necessary to add a mechanism to produce more detailed quantifiable predictions than those produced by the original focusing heuristics described in (Ros6 et al. , 1995). 
4 Discourse Processing and Disambiguation Context-based ranking of ambiguities is performed by the plan-based discourse processor described in (Rosd et aL. , 1995) which is based on (Lambert and Carberry, 1992; Lambert, 1993). 
This work has been carried out in the context of Enthusiast, a Spanish-to-English speech-to-speech translation system (Woszcyna et al. , 1993; Suhm et al. , 1994; Levin et al. , 1995), which currently translates spontaneous dialogues between two people trying to schedule a meeting time. 
Using Discourse Predictions for Ambiguity Resolution Yan Qu, Carolyn P. Ros6 and Barbara Di Eugenio Computational Linguistics Program Department of Philosophy Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213 {yqu,cprose} (6) cs.cmu.edu,dieugeni~cmu.cdu Abstract In this paper we discuss how we allply discourse predictions along with non context-based predictions to the problem of parse disambiguation in Enthusiast, a Spanish-to-English translation system (Woszcyna et al. , 1993; Snhm et al. , 1994; Levin el; al. , 1995).

In order to circumvent this obstacle several approaches have been presented, among them active learning (Shen et al. , 2004) and rule-based systems encoding domain specific knowledge (Gaizauskas et al. , 2003). 
7 Related Work In recent years active learning has been widely studied in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as word sense disambiguation (Chen et al., 2006; Zhu and Hovy, 2007), text classification (TC) (Lewis and Gale, 1994; McCallum and Nigam, 1998), named entity recognition (NER) (Shen et al., 2004), chunking (Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000), information extraction (IE) (Thompson et al., 1999), and statistical parsing (Tang et al., 2002). 
Settles (2009) gives a detailed overview of the literature on AL. It has been experimentally shown that AL can indeed be successfully applied to a range of NLP tasks including, e.g., text categorization (Lewis and Gale, 1994), part-of-speech tagging (Dagan and Engelson, 1995; Ringger et al., 2007), parsing (Becker and Osborne, 2005), and named entity recognition (Shen et al., 2004; Tomanek et al., 2007). 
Recently there have been some studies on adapting NER systems to new domains employing techniques such as active learning and semi-supervised learning (Shen et al. , 2004; Mohit and Hwa, 2005), 80 or incorporating external lexical knowledge (Ciaramita and Altun, 2005). 
In recent years active learning  has attracted a lot of research interest, and has been studied in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification (TC) (Lewis and Gale, 1994; McCallum and Nigam, 1998), chunking (Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000), named entity recognition (NER) (Shen et al., 2004; Tomanek et al., 2007), part-of-speech tagging (Engelson and Dagan, 1999), information extraction (Thompson et  al., 1999), statistical parsing (Steedman et al., 2003), and word sense disambiguation (Zhu and Hovy, 2007).

In (Zens et al., 2007), the MERT criterion is optimized on N-best lists using the Downhill Simplex algorithm (Press et al., 2007, p. 503).


Taking Ochs MERT procedure as a baseline, (Zens et al., 2007) experimentwithdifferenttrainingcriteriaforSMT and obtain the best results for a criterion they call expected BLEU score.

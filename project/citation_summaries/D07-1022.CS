The addition of vertical markovization enables non-pruned models to outperform all previously reported re12Cohen and Smith (2007) make use of a parameter () which is tuned separately for each of the tasks. 
This is by now a fairly standard representation for multiple morphological segmentation of Hebrew utterances (Adler, 2001; Bar-Haim et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2005; Cohen and Smith, 2007; Adler, 2007). 
Table 2 compares the performance of our system on the setup of Cohen and Smith (2007) to the best results reported by them for the same tasks. 
Cohen and Smith (2007) later on based a system for joint inference on factored, independent, morphological and syntactic components of which scores are combined to cater for the joint inference task. 
Morphological segmentation decisions in our model are delegated to a lexeme-based PCFG and we show that using a simple treebank grammar, a data-driven lexicon, and a linguistically motivated unknown-tokens handling our model outperforms (Tsarfaty, 2006) and (Cohen and Smith, 2007) on the joint task and achieves state-of-the-art results on a par with current respective standalone models.2 2 Modern Hebrew Structure Segmental morphology Hebrew consists of seven particles m( from ) f ( when / who / that ) h( the ) w( and ) k( like ) l( to ) and b( in ).

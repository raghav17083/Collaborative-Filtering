Since we used the latest release of FrameNet in order to use a greater number of hierarchical role-to-role relations, we could not make a direct comparison of performance with that of existing systems; however we may say that the 89.00% F1 micro-average of our baseline system is roughly comparable to the 88.93% value of Bejan and Hathaway (2007) for SemEval-2007 (Baker et al., 2007).

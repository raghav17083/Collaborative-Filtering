The function sem-quant is a function that performs the sem-quant pair manipulations described in Woods (1978b).


Conclusions In Woods (1977, 1978a; Woods & Brachman, 1978), I discussed the general principle of hypothesis "factoring" i.e., the coalescing of common parts of alternative hypotheses in such a way that an incremental hypothesis development and search algorithm does not need to individuate and consider separate hypotheses until sufficient information is present to make different predictions in the different cases.

Woods Cascaded ATN Grammars Rusty Bobrow's RUS parser (Bobrow, 1978) is the first parser to my knowledge to make a clean separation between syntactic and semantic specification while gaining the benefit of early and incremental semantic filtering and maintaining the factoring advantages of an ATN.

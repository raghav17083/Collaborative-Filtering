Labeled data for one domain might be used to train a initial classifier for another (possibly related) domain, and then bootstrapping can be employed to learn new knowledge from the new domain (Blitzer et al., 2007). 
We use five sentiment classification datasets, including the widely-used movie review dataset [MOV] (Pang et al., 2002) as well as four datasets containing reviews of four different types of products from Amazon [books (BOO), DVDs (DVD), electronics (ELE), and kitchen appliances (KIT)] (Blitzer et al., 2007). 
2 Previous Work So far, Structural Correspondence Learning has been applied successfully to PoS tagging and Sentiment Analysis (Blitzer et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2007). 
4 Structural Correspondence Learning SCL (Structural Correspondence Learning) (Blitzer et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2007; Blitzer, 2008) is a recently proposed domain adaptation technique which uses unlabeled data from both source and target domain to learn correspondences between features from different domains. 
4 Evaluation 4.1 Experimental Setup For evaluation, we use five sentiment classification datasets, including the widely-used movie review dataset [MOV] (Pang et al., 2002) as well as four datasets that contain reviews of four different types of product from Amazon [books (BOO), DVDs (DVD), electronics (ELE), and kitchen appliances (KIT)] (Blitzer et al., 2007).

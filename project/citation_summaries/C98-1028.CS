One of the major current applications of parsers that operate incrementally is for language modelling in speech recognition (Brill et al. , 1998; Jelinek and Chelba, 1999).


A user study (Brill et al. , 1998) showed that humans can utilize linguistic knowledge at various levels to improve the SR output by selecting the best utterance hypotheses from N-best lists.

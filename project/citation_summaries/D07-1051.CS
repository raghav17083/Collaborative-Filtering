Settles (2009) gives a detailed overview of the literature on AL. It has been experimentally shown that AL can indeed be successfully applied to a range of NLP tasks including, e.g., text categorization (Lewis and Gale, 1994), part-of-speech tagging (Dagan and Engelson, 1995; Ringger et al., 2007), parsing (Becker and Osborne, 2005), and named entity recognition (Shen et al., 2004; Tomanek et al., 2007). 
In recent years active learning  has attracted a lot of research interest, and has been studied in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification (TC) (Lewis and Gale, 1994; McCallum and Nigam, 1998), chunking (Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000), named entity recognition (NER) (Shen et al., 2004; Tomanek et al., 2007), part-of-speech tagging (Engelson and Dagan, 1999), information extraction (Thompson et  al., 1999), statistical parsing (Steedman et al., 2003), and word sense disambiguation (Zhu and Hovy, 2007). 
The definition of our intrinsic stopping criterion for committee-based AL builds on the notions of Selection Agreement (Tomanek et al., 2007), and Validation Set Agreement (Tomanek and Hahn, 2008). 
In NLP, sometimes a simplifying assumption is made that the annotation cost for an example can be measured in terms of its length (e.g. seconds of voicemail annotated (Kapoor et al., 2007); number of tokens annotated (Tomanek et al., 2007)). 
AL has been successfully applied already for a wide range of NLP tasks, including POS tagging (Engelson and Dagan, 1996), chunking (Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000), statistical parsing (Hwa, 2004), and named entity recognition (Tomanek et al., 2007).

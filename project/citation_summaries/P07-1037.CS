 Supertagging (Hassan et al., 2007b): incorporating lexical syntactic descriptions, in the form of supertags, to the language model and target side of the translation model in order to better inform decoding. 
(Huang and Knight, 2006) and (Hassan et al., 2007) introduce relabeling and supertagging on the target side, respectively. 
Other recent approaches, e.g., (Birch et al., 2007; Hassan et al., 2007; Hassan et al., 2008a) incorporate a linear-time supertagger into SMT to take the role of a syntactic language model alongside the standard language model. 
2 Related Work There have been various efforts to integrate linguistic knowledge into SMT systems, either from the target side (Marcu et al., 2006; Hassan et al., 2007; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006), the source side (Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006) or both sides (Eisner, 2003; Ding et al., 2005; Koehn and Hoang, 2007), just to name a few. 
For both Arabic-English (Hassan et al. , 2007) and our experiments in Dutch-English, n-gram models over CCG supertags improve the quality of translation.

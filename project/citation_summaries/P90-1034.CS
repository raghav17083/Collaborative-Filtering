For example, Hindle (1990) used cooccurrences between verbs and their subjects and objects, and proposed a similarity metric based on mutual information, but no exploration concerning the effectiveness of other kinds of word relationship is provided, although it is extendable to any kinds of contextual information. 
Ours is 772 similar to (Grefenstette, 1994; Hindle, 1990; Ruge, 1992) in the use of dependency relationship as the word features, based on which word similarities are computed. 
1 Introduction Distributional Similarity has been an active research area for more than a decade (Hindle, 1990), (Ruge, 1992), (Grefenstette, 1994), (Lee, 1997), (Lin, 1998), (Dagan et al. , 1999), (Weeds and Weir, 2003). 
4.5 Hindles Measure Hindle (1990) proposed an MI-based measure, which he used to show that nouns could be reliably clustered based on their verb co-occurrences. 
Syntactic context information is used (Hindle, 1990; Ruge, 1992; Lin, 1998) to compute term similarities, based on which similar words to a particular word can directly be returned.

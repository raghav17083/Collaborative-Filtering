4,500, 5 kg NETE Terms Maximum Entropy, Archeology Table 1: The named entity tagset used for the shared task  Affixes like Hyderabad, Rampur, Mehdipatnam, Lingampally  Gazetteer features: class in the gazetteer  Left and right context  Token length, e.g. the number of letters in a word  Previous history in the document or the corpus  Classes of preceding NEs The machine learning techniques tried for NER include the following:  Hidden Markov Models or HMM (Zhou and Su, 2001)  Decision Trees (Isozaki, 2001)  Maximum Entropy (Borthwick et al., 1998)  Support Vector Machines or SVM (Takeuchi and Collier, 2002)  Conditional Random Fields or CRF (Settles, 2004) Different ways of classifying named entities have been used, i.e., there are more than one tagsets for NER. 
We use Isozakis NE recognizer (Isozaki, 2001). 
The recognizer runs at a rate of only 85 bytes/sec on an Athlon 1.3 GHz Linux PC, while rule-based systems (e.g. , Isozaki, (2001)) can process several kilobytes in a second. 
Statistical methods such as HMM (Bikel et al., 1997; Zhou and Su, 2001), Decision tree model (Baluja et al., 2000; Isozaki, 2001), and conditional random fields (McCallum, 2003) have been used. 
We also use additional data by Isozaki (2001).

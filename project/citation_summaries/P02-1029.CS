Previous research has demonstrated that clustering can be useful in inferring Levin-style semantic classes (Levin, 1993) from both English and German verb subcategorization information (Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Schulte im Walde, 2000; Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002). 
The results, shown in Table 2, demonstrate that both clustering methods perform significantly 9Our definition differs by a factor of 2 from that of Schulte im Walde and Brew (2002). 
(Carroll et al. , 1998b), important for many NLP tasks (e.g. automatic verb classification (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002)) and useful for any application which can benefit from information about predicate-argument structure (e.g. Information Extraction (IE) (Surdeanu et al. , 2003)). 
In recent research in the field, the main effort has been to infer semantic classes for verbs, in English (Stevenson et al. , 1999) and German (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002). 
2.2 Clustering of Verb SCF Distributions There is some related work on clustering of verbs according to their SCF probability distributions (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; Korhonen et al. , 2003).

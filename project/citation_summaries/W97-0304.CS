5 Segmentation Segmentation breaks a line into one or more segments, which are passed separately to subsequent modules (Ejerhed, 1996) (Beeferman et al. , 1997). 
The methods in this group use probabilistic frameworks including maximal entropy (Beeferman et al. , 1997), Hidden Markov Models (Mulbregt et al. , 1998) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (Blei and Moreno, 2001). 
3.1 Domain-specific Cue Phrases Many discourse segmentation techniques (e.g. Hirschberg and Litman, 1993) as well as some topic segmentation algorithms rely on cue words and phrases (e.g. Beeferman et al. , 1997), but the types of cue words used vary greatly. 
The main focus of most work on text segmentation is topic-based segmentation of news text (e.g., (Hearst, 1997; Beeferman et al., 1997)), but there have been some previous attempts at identifying functional zones in email messages. 
The uses of this procedure include information retrieval (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993; Hearst, 1994; Yaari, 1997; Reynar, 1999), summarization (Reynar, 1998), text understanding, anaphora resolution (Kozima, 1993), language modelling (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Beeferman et al. , 199717) and improving document navigation for the visually disabled (Choi, 2000).

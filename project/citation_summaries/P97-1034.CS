The determination as to whether a particular utterance constituted an acknowledgment or a command was based primarily on word choice and dialogue context; this approach is consistent with definitions of this behavior, e.g., Chu-Carroll and Brown (1997).

These are also called "back channels" or "prompts" (e.g. , Chu-Carroll & Brown, 1997), Closely related to acknowledgments are repetitions, in which the conversant provides a stronger signal that a contribution has been understood by repeating part or all of the other's contribution.

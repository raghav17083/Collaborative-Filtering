Example scenario with 12 vehicles 3 The Best-First Procedure The basic mechanism of the best-first search algorithm is a generalization of the incremental version: instead of successively adding attributes to the full expression generated so far, all intermediate results are accessible for this operation, producing an optimal solution, if completed  see (Horacek 2003) for details. 
To avoid the generation of redundant descriptions that is typical for incremental approaches, Gardent [2002] and Horacek [2003] proposed exhaustive resp. 
Mediating between these two extreme search paradigms, we have developed a best-first searching algorithm that avoids the major deficit of the incremental approach (Horacek 2003). 
To avoid the generation of redundant descriptions what incremental approaches typically do, Gardent (2002) and Horacek (2003) proposed exhaustive resp. 
Subsequent work on referring expression generation has expanded the logical framework to allow reference by negation (the dog that is not black) and references to multiple entities (the brown or black dogs) (van Deemter, 2002), explored different search algorithms for nding the minimal description (e.g. , Horacek (2003)) and offered different representation frameworks like graph theory (Krahmer et al. , 2003) as alternatives to AVMs.

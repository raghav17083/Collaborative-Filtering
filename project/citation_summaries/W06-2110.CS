Other researchers (Pantel and Ravichandran 2004; Pantel and Pennacchiotti 2006; Pennacchiotti and Pantel 2006) use clustering techniques coupled with syntactic dependency features to identify IS-A relations in large text collections.Kim and Baldwin (2005) propose a general-purpose method that computes the lexical similarity of unseen nounnoun compounds with those found in training.More recently Kim and Baldwin (2006) developed an automatic method for interpreting nounnoun compounds based on a set of 20 semantic relations.The relations are detected based on a xed set of constructions involving the constituent nouns and a set of seed verbs denoting the semantic relation (e.g., to own denotes POSSESSION).Then all nounnoun instances 4 These results were obtained on AltaVista on a general and abstract set of eight prepositions (Lauer 1995) as semantic classication categories: of,for,with,in,on,at,about,andfrom.


Prepositions in computational linguistics In order to incorporate prepositions into various resources and applications, it is necessary to perform rst a systematic investigation of their syntax and semantics.Various researchers (Dorr 1993; Litkowski and Hargraves 2005; Saint-Dizier 2005b; Lersundi and Aggire 2006) have already provided inventories of preposition senses in English and other languages.Others have focused on the analysis of verb particles (Baldwin 2006a, 2006b; Villavicencio 2006), the distributional similarity (Baldwin 2005) and the semantics of prepositions (Kordoni 2005) in a multilingual context, and the meaning of prepositions in applications such as prepositional phrase attachment (OHara and Wiebe 2003; Kordoni 2006; Volk 2006).

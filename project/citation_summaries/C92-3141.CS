Mitjushin (1992) has proposed similar links on a higher syntactic level, using a rule-based approach.


At the first stage the parser constructs fragments containing 'high-l)rnbability' links; as a result, on average 70 80% of all syntactic links of a sentence are established (for details see Mitjushin 1992).

Much of the work in subjectivity analysis has been applied to English data, though work on other languages is growing: e.g., Japanese data are used in (Kobayashi et al., 2004; Suzuki et al., 2006; Takamura et al., 2006; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006), Chinese data are used in (Hu et al., 2005), and German data are used in (Kim and Hovy, 2006). 
Researchers have found this at various levels of analysis, including the manual annotation of phrases (Takamura et al., 2006), sentiment classification of phrases (Wilson et al., 2005), sentiment tagging of words (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006b), and sentiment tagging of word senses (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006a). 
Though we do not discuss the problem of determining semantic orientation, we assume availability of state-of-the-art methods that perform this task (Suzuki et al. , 2006; Takamura et al. , 2006, etc.). 
While work on subjectivity analysis in other languages is growing (e.g. , Japanese data are used in (Takamura et al. , 2006; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006), Chinese data are used in (Hu et al. , 2005), and German data are used in (Kim and Hovy, 2006)), much of the work in subjectivity analysis has been applied to English data. 
This is reported in studies of manual annotation of phrases (Takamura et al. , 2006), recognizing contextual polarity of expressions (Wilson et al. , 2005), and sentiment tagging of words and word senses (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006).

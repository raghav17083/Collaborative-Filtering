For example, Grefenstette and Teufel (1995) used some linguistic properties to weed out potential light verbs from lists sorted by raw frequency, while Dras and Johnson (1996) used frequency of the verb weighted by a weak predictor of its prior probability as a light verb. 
2 Background and Introduction NLP techniques have been applied to extraction of information from corpora for tasks such as free indexing (extraction of descriptors from corpora), (Metzler and Haas, 1989; Schwarz, 1990; Sheridan and Smeaton, 1992; Strzalkowski, 1996), term acquisition (Smadja and McKeown, 1991; Bourigault, 1993; Justeson and Katz, 1995; Dallle, 1996), or extraction of lin9uistic information e.g. support verbs (Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995), and event structure of verbs (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992). 
The work reported in Grefenstette and Teufel (1995) for finding empty support verbs used in nominalisations is also related to the present work. 
Previous research on LVCs, on the other hand, has primarily focused on their automatic extraction (e.g. , Grefenstette and Teufel 1995; Dras and Johnson 1996; Moiron 2004; though see Stevenson et al. 2004). 
First, the work has looked at any nominalizations as complements of potential light verbs (what they term support verbs) (Fontenelle, 1993; Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995; Dras and Johnson, 1996).

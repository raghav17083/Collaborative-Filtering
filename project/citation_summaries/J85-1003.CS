As for the known difficulties concerning e.g. the formulation of fail-soft rules or the presence of surface clues (see Slocum, 1985,5; Vauquois and Boitet, 1985), it appears that for a multilingual system of MT these disadvantages have to be compared with those present in the large number of binary systems which are otherwise necessary. 
It is hard to find an elegant and transparent way of specifying rule order in a compositional grammar; the situation is more complicated than in transformational systems llke ROBRA (Vauquois and Boitet, 1985), because rules may have more than one argument.

Three examples of such systems are (1) GETA/ARIANE (Vauquois and Boitet 1985; Boitet 1987); (2) LMT (McCord 1989); and (3) METAL (Alonso 1990; Thurmair 1990). 
Thus a number of matchine translation (MT) projects~ especially ones employing a ~ransfer strategy, make use of format systems for grammar specification, which, in addition to mapping surface strings into con~esponding language structures, identify operations to be associated with nodes and / or subtrees (Vauquois & Boitet, 1985; Nagao et al. , 1985).

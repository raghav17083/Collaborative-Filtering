Many researchers (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al. , 2005a) use feature-based methods Figure 1: Semantic role labeling in a phrase structure syntactic tree representation for argument identification and classification in building SRL systems and participating in evaluations, such as Senseval-3 1, CoNLL-2004 and 2005 shared tasks: SRL (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005), where a flat feature vector is usually used to represent a predicate-argument structure.

3.4 Semantic Role Classification In our system, the identification and classification of semantic roles are achieved in a single stage (Liu et al., 2005) through one single classifier (actually two, one for noun predicates, and the other for verb predicates). 
Their results on the WSJ test equal the best results published so far on this task and datasets (Pradhan et al. , 2005a), though they are not directly comparable due to a different setting in defining arguments not perfectly matching the predicted parse constituents. 
Stage 4: A rule-based post-processing stage (Liu et al. , 2005) is used to handle some unmatched arguments with constituents, such as AM-MOD, AM-NEG.

(2005) and McDonald and Pereira (2006). 
The most popular strategy for capturing nonprojective structures in data-driven dependency parsing is to apply some kind of post-processing to the output of a strictly projective dependency parser, as in pseudo-projective parsing (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005), corrective modeling (Hall and Novak, 2005), or approximate non-projective parsing (McDonald and Pereira, 2006). 
However, this algorithm cannot be generalized to the second-order setting  McDonald and Pereira (2006) proved that this problem is NPhard, and described an approximate greedy search algorithm. 
Previous studies (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Zhang and Clark, 2008) show that the accuracies of complete trees are about 40% for English and about 35% for Chinese, while the accuracies of relations between two words are much higher: about 90% for English and about 85% for Chinese.

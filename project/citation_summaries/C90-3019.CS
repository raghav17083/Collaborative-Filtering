Since conceptual structures are used for example in text generation (Bourbeau et al. 1990) or knowledge-based machine translation (Nirenburg et al. 1992), typed feature structures provide an attractive alternative to current procedural implementations. 
Examples include papers by Porter (1987), Emele and Zajac (1990), and Emele et al. 
The appropriate classification of domain knowledge concepts such as chase, cat, mouse, and little in terms of the general semantic types of the upper model (in this case, directed-action, object, object, and size respectively -for definitions see: \[Bateman et al. , 1990\]) automatically provides information about syntactic realization that needs to be explicitly stated in the MUMBLE-86 input (e.g. , S-V-O_two-explicit-args, rip-common-noun, restrictive-modifier, adjective).

There s This observation is predicted by Nakhimovsky's work on the discourse structure of narrative text, in which it is suggested that paragraph breaks accompany discontinuities (Nakhimovsky & Rapaport 1988; Naldaimovsky 1988). 
In short, we believe Reichman (1978) only intended that tense and aspect could signal discourse segment boundaries, and thus indirectly influence pronoun interpretation, while Nakhimovsky (1988) claims that a change in time scale, aspectual class, or other temporal characteristics could signal a new discourse segment, and thus, indirectly influence pronoun interpretation. 
(Worline 1956: 1) Rhetorically speaking, sentence (b) interrupts a sequence of events described in (a) (= DS1) to start DS2, a description, fit order to recognize this rhetorical relation between the two DSs, it is necessary to recognize that: (1) there is a shift of topic; (2) there is a shift in perceptual modality to visuai perception; (3) there is a shift in time scale,from the events of the cun'ent day to years or decades, associated with the lifetime of a windmill and the 'where they lived' clause; (4) there is shift in Sl~tial scale from a household to the entire prairie; (5) there is a shift from a foregrounded sequence of events to the "mopping-up" operation of filling in the background; the shift is signaled by aspectual changes (Hopper 1978; Nakhimovsky 1987b, 1988); and (6) the foregrounded sequence of events includes two telic processes (walking fi'om rite house to the windmill; fixing the broken part) whose beginnings or preconditions are explicitly mentioned but whose terminal points are still in the future relative to the Temporal Focus; this sets up expectations for the reader. 
Nakhimovsky and Rapaport (1988) suggest that in narrative, paragraph breaks accompany changes in POV, but they did not investigate this hypothesis experimentally. 
As explained in Suri (1993), our claim that aspectual classification might play a role in the interpretation of pronouns in a subsequent sentence is distinct from the hypotheses of other researchers about the role of tense and aspect (e.g. , Nakhimovsky 1988; Reichman 1978) in pronoun interpretation.

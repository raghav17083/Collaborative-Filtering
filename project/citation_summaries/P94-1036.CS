In addition, SynchUVG-DL can be used for modeling the syntax of languages with syntactic constructions which have been argued to be beyond the formal power of TAG, such as scrambling in German and many other languages (Rainbow, 1994) or wh-movement in Kashmiri (Rambow, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir, 1995). 
Rambow (1994a) proposes detailed analyses of a large range of different word order phenomena in German using V-TAG and thereby shows the linguistic usefulness of V-TAG. 
Thus when Y--o X combines with its argument, whose derivation includes Z, the latter's variable becomes bound, e.g. lu.w(lz.u) + x(yz) =~ w(Iz.x(yz)) 3.2 Multiset-valued Linear Indexed Grammar Rambow (1994) introduces the multiset-valued linear indexed grammar formalism ({}-LIG). 
An alternative formalism for scrambling is V-TAG (Rambow 1994a, 1994b; Rambow and Lee 1994), a formalism that has nicer formal properties than nonlocal MCTAG. 
Finally, Vijay-Shanker, Weir, and Rainbow (1995), using techniques developed for UVG-DL (Rainbow 1994a; Becker and Rambow 1995), show that the languages generated by lexicalized DSG can be recognized in polynomial time.

(Li et al., 2004) solved the CDC problem by adopting a probabilistic view on how documents are generated and how names are sprinkled into them. 
In our experiments we use data from the English and Chinese stories from the Xinhua News agency for about 6 months of 2001.2 We assume that we have identified names for persons and locationstwo types that have a strong tendency to be transliterated wholly or mostly phoneticallyin the English text; in this work we use the named-entity recognizer described in (Li et al. , 2004), which is based on the SNoW machine learning toolkit (Carlson et al. , 1999). 
(Knight and Graehl, 1998; Meng et al. , 2001; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Gao et al. , 2004)  has mostly assumed that one has a training lexicon of transliteration pairs, from which one can learn a model, often a sourcechannel or MaxEnt-based model. 
(Li et al., 2004) solved the robust reading problem by adopting a probabilistic view on how documents are generated and how names are sprinkled into them. 
We then extract named-entities in the English text using the named-entity recognizer described in (Li et al. , 2004), which is based on the SNoW machine learning toolkit (Carlson et al. , 1999).

It is implemented in DATR, an inheritance-based lexical knowledge representation formalism (Evans and Gazdar 1996). 
REFLEX makes use of DATR, a non-monotonic inheritance based lexical representation language (Evans & Gazdar, 1996) to carry out this process. 
The most common linguistic application for default inheritance is to encode lexical generalizations (e.g. , Boguraev and Pustejovsky 1990; Briscoe, Copestake, and Boguraev 1990; Vossen and Copestake 1993; Daelemans 1987; Evans and Gazdar 1989a, 1989b, 1996; Flickinger, Pollard, and Wasow 1985; Flickinger 1987; Flickinger and Nerbonne 1992; Kilgarriff 1993; Krieger and Nerbonne 1993; Sanfilippo 1993; Shieber 1986a), but defaults have also been used for specification in syntactic theory (e.g. , Gazdar 1987; Shieber 1986b), and for the analysis of gapping constructions (Kaplan 1987) and ellipsis (Grover et al. 1994). 
irregularity was implemented in the lexical knowledge representation language DATR (Evans and Gazdar 1996) and is available at the DATR archive from the DATR webpages (http://www.datr.org). 
In contrast to the approach presented in this section, the work described in (Cahill et al. , 2000) is set in an untyped feature system using DATR to define inheritance networks with path-value equations (Evans and Gazdar, 1996).

Plan-based approaches (Allen and Perrault 1979; Litman 1986; Carberry 1990; Lambert and Carberry 1991) start by applying context-independent inference rules to identify the agent's task-related plan, possibly favoring alternatives that extend a previously recognized plan. 
4.2 Discourse Recipes In previous work, we noted the need to differentiate among domain, problem-solving, and discourse actions (Lambert and Carberry 1991; Elzer 1995). 
4 Response Generation in Collaborative Negotiation In order to capture the agents' intentions conveyed by their utterances, our model of collaborative negotiation utilizes an enhanced version of the dialogue model described in (Lambert and Carberry, 1991) to represent the current status of the interaction. 
We then compare our approach to discourse 528 Lochbaum A Collaborative Planning Model processing with previous plan-based approaches (Litman 1985; Litman and Allen 1987; Lambert and Carberry 1991; Ramshaw 1991) and show that our approach is aimed at recognizing and reasoning with a different type of intention. 
8.2 Other Approaches Lambert and Carberry (1991) have revised Litman and Allen's dichotomy of plans into a trichotomy of discourse, problem-solving, and domain plans.

We believe that there exist many more opportunities for future exploration; as an example, there are remarkable similarities between information nuggets in definition question answering and recently-proposed methods for assessing summaries basedon fine-grainedsemantic units(Teufel andvan Halteren, 2004; Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004). 
One research direction that we are interested in pursuing is investigating whether the information repeated in multiple descriptions of a particular entry corresponds to the pyramid summarization model (Teufel and Halteren, 2004; Nenkova et al., 2007). 
Halteren and Teufel, for example, provide a method for annotation of content units and study consensus across summarizers (van Halteren and Teufel, 2003; Teufel and van Halteren, 2004b). 
Different approaches have been proposed to measure matches using words or more meaningful semantic units, for example, ROUGE (Lin, 2004), factoid analysis (Teufel and Halteren, 2004), pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004), and Basic Element (BE) (Hovy et al., 2006). 
(Teufel and van Halteren 2004) used a factoid agreement analysis of human summaries for a single document and concluded that a resulting consensus summary is stable only if 3040 summaries are collected.

B.Semantic scattering The semantic scattering (SS) model was initially tested on the classication of genitive constructions, but it is also applicable to nominal phrases and compounds (Moldovan et al.2004).SS is a supervised model which, like the SVM model described previously, reliesonWordNetsIS-A semantic hierarchy to learn a function which separates positive and negative examples.Essentially, it consists of using a training data set to establish a boundary G  on WordNet noun hierarchies such that each feature pair of nounnoun senses f ij on this boundary maps uniquely into one of a predened list of semantic relations.The algorithm starts with the most general boundary corresponding to the entity WordNet noun hierarchy and then specializes it based on the training data until a good approximation is reached. 
A few recent works (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Keller et al. , 2002; Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) used the web to collect statistics on word cooccurrences. 
Studying relationships between tagged named entities, (Hasegawa et al, 2004; Hassan et al, 2006) proposed unsupervised clustering methods that assign given (or semi-automatically extracted) sets of pairs into several clusters, where each cluster corresponds to one of a known relationship type. 
Moldovan et al (2004) also use WordNet. 
3 Semantic Calculus 3.1 Semantic relations For this study, we adopt a revised version of the semantic relation set proposed by (Moldovan et al. , 2004).

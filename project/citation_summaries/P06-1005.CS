(1998) and Bergsma and Lin (2006) show that learned gender is the most important feature in their pronoun resolution systems. 
Indeed, such feature-based methods have been widely applied in parsing (Collins 1999; Charniak 2001), semantic role labeling (Pradhan et al 2005), semantic relation extraction (Zhou et al 2005) and co-reference resolution  (Lapin and Leass 1994; Aone and Bennett 1995; Mitkov 1998; Yang et al 2004; Luo and Zitouni 2005; Bergsma and Lin 2006). 
Bergsma and Lin (2006) presented an approach to pronoun resolution based on syntactic paths. 
We use the approach of Bergsma and Lin (2006), both because it achieves state-of-the-art gender classification performance, and because a database of the obtained noun genders is available online.1 Bergsma and Lin (2006) use an unsupervised algorithm to identify syntactic paths along which a noun and pronoun are highly likely to corefer. 
2 Related Work Related work on exploring syntactic structured information in pronoun resolution can be typically classified into three categories: parse tree-based search algorithms (Hobbs 1978), feature-based (Lappin and Leass 1994; Bergsma and Lin 2006) and tree kernel-based methods (Yang et al 2006).

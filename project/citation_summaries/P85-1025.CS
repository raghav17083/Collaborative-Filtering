The separation of these two requirements 7 A more precise account of what it means to be able to identify an object is beyond the scope of this paper; for further details, see the discussions by Hobbs (1985), Appelt (1985), Kronfeld (1986, 1990), and Morgenstern (1988). 
The approach undertaken by Appelt and Kronfeld (Appelt, 1985a, Appelt, 1985b, Kronfeld, 1986, Appelt, Kronfeld, 1987) is very elaborate but it suffers from very limited coverage, missing assessments of the relative benefit of alternatives, and notorious inefficiency. 
This type of reference is different from the type that has been studied traditionally by researchers who have usually assumed that the agents have mutual knowledge of the referent (Appelt, 1985a; Appelt and Kronfeld, 1987; Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986; Heeman and Hirst, 1992; Searle, 1969), are copreseut with the referent (Heeman and Hirst, 1992; Cohen, 1981), or have the referent in their focus of attention (Reiter and Dale, 1992). 
The approach undertaken by Appelt and Kronfeld (Appelt, 1985a, Appelt, 1985b, Kronfeld, 1986, Appelt, Kronfeld, 1987) is very elaborate but it suffers from limited coverage, missing assessments of the relative benefit of alternatives, and notorious inefficiency. 
The recipe's constraints, however, require that D be of the appropriate sort, according to the constraint .T(6, Pi), for the identification of the parameter to be successful (Appelt 1985; Kronfeld 1986, 1990; Hintikka 1978).

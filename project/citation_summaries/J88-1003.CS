Methods using the short context of a word in order to resolve ambiguity (usually categorical ambiguity) are very common in English and other languages (DeRose 1988; Church 1988; Karlsson 1990). 
1 We calculate P(W) using the tag sequence of W as an intermediate quantity, and summing, over all possible tag sequences, the probability of the sentence with that tagging; that is: P(W) = ~ P(W, T) T where T is a tag sequence for sentence W. The above probabilities are estimated as is traditionally done in trigram-based part-of-speech tagging (Church, 1988; DeRose, 1988): P(W,T) = P(WIT)P(T ) (1) = HP(wi\[ti) HP(t, lt,_2t,_l)(2) i i where T = tltn, and P(ti\]tl-2ti-1) is the prob ability of seeing a part-of-speech tag tl given the two preceding part-of-speech tags ti-2 and ti-1. 
As a result, the empirical approach has been adopted by almost all contemporary part-of-speech programs: Bahl and Mercer (1976), Leech, Garside, and Atwell (1983), Jelinek (1985), Deroualt and Merialdo (1986), Garside, Leech, and Sampson (1987), Church (1988), DeRose (1988), Hindle (1989), Kupiec (1989, 1992), Ayuso et al. 
This agrees with the results on the closed dictionary (i.e. , without unknown words) obtained by other researchers for this class of the model on the same corpus (Kupiec 1992; DeRose 1988). 
Statistical methods have also been used (e.g. , \[DeRose, 1988\], \[Garside et al. , 1987\]).

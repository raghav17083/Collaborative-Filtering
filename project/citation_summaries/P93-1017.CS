5 This would account 4 The formulation of derivation for tree-adjoining grammars is also of significance for other grammatical formalisms based on weaker forms of adjunction such as lexicalized context-free grammar (Schabes and Waters 1993a) and its stochastic extension (Schabes and Waters 1993b), though we do not discuss these arguments here. 
2 In Schabes and Waters (1993a) these three kinds of auxiliary trees are referred to differently, as right recursive, left recursive, and centrally recursive, respectively. 
Sponsorship is closely related to lexicalization in TAGs and CFGs (Schabes 1990, 1992; Schabes, AbeillG and Joshi 1988; Schabes and Waters 1993; Vijay-Shanker and Schabes 1992). 
Although introduced with reference to LTAGs, this optimization concerns any portion of a grammar where rules include one or more potential lexical anchors such as Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Pollard and Sag, 1987) or Lexicalized Context-Free Grammar (Schabes and Waters, 1993). 
One could allow at most one left auxiliary tree and one right auxiliary tree as we did in Schabes and Waters (1993a).

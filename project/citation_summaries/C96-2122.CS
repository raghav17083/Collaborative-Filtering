It uses the information in the 4The basis of our work is (Lombardo and Lesmo, 1996), where the authors present an Earley-type recognizer for dependency grammar, and propose the compilation of dependency rules into parse tables. 
To our knowledge, there has been no other formal study of DG.This is reflected by a recent study (Lombardo & Lesmo, 1996), which applies the Earley parsing technique (Earley, 1970) to DG, and thereby achieves cubic time complexity for the analysis of DG. 
However, predictive grammar-based algorithms such as those of Lombardo and Lesmo (1996) and Kahane et al. 
One of such properties, projectivity, requires that any word occurring between a word a9 and a word a10 dependent on a9 be dominated by a9a12a11 In first dependency grammars (Gaifman, 1961) and in some more recent proposals: link grammars (Sleator and Temperly, 1993), projective dependency grammars (Lombardo and Lesmo, 1996) the projectivity is implied by definition. 
339 4 The complexity of DG Recognition Lombardo & Lesmo (1996, p.728) convey their hope that increasing the flexibility of their conception of DG will " imply the restructuring of some parts of the recognizer, with a plausible increment of the complexity".

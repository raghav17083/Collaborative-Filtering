This is essentially the difference between deterministic LR parsing (Knuth, 1965) and Generalized-LR parsing (Tomita, 1987; Tomita, 1990).


A line of research that the author is pursuing currently (Wittenburg 1992b) is to design a more specialized grammar formalism that finesses some of the complexity of residuation and unification through a version of "pseudo-unification" (Tomita 1990).

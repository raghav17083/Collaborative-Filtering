In addition to this phrase translation probability feature, Hieros feature set includes the inverse phrase translation probability log p( f|e), lexical weights lexwt( f|e) and lexwt(e| f), which are estimates of translation quality based on word-level correspondences (Koehn et al., 2003), and a rule penalty allowing the model to learn a preference for longer or shorter derivations; see (Chiang, 2007) for details. 
(2007), who modify syntax-based extraction and binarize trees (following (Wang et al., 2007b)) to improve phrasal cov1009 erage. 
The approach we take here is head-out binarization (Wang et al. , 2007), where any constituent with more than two children is split into partial constituents. 
In addition, various researchers have explored the use of hard linguistic constraints on the source side, e.g. via  chunking noun phrases and translating them separately (Owczarzak et al., 2006), or by performing hard reorderings of source parse trees in order to more closely approximate target-language word order (Wang et al., 2007a; Collins et al., 2005). 
(6) 4 Related Work The concept of packed forest has been previously used in translation rule extraction, for example in rule composition (Galley et al., 2006) and tree binarization (Wang et al., 2007).

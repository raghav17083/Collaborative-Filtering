(Murray et al., 2005) showed low correlation of ROUGE and human evaluation in meeting summarization evaluation; however, they 201 simply used ROUGE as is and did not take into account the meeting characteristics during evaluation. 
All the meetings have been transcribed and annotated with dialog acts (DA) (Shriberg et al., 2004), topics, and extractive summaries (Murray et al., 2005). 
A variety of approaches have been investigated for speech summarization, for example, maximum entropy, conditional random fields, latent semantic analysis, support vector machines, maximum marginal relevance (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2003; Hori et al., 2003; Buist et al., 2005; Galley, 2006; Murray et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2007; Xie and Liu, 2008).

Because style is a global aspect of text, a certain style can be (and should be) achieved by more than just lexical choice; structural choices are just as important (DiMarco and Hirst 1993). 
In DiMarco and Hirst (1993), DiMarco et al (1992), Green (1992), and tloyt (forthcoming), we describe the construction of a syntactic stylistic grammar that relates stylistic goals to abstract stylistic properties, and then relates these abstract properties to low-level syntax. 
Given a hierarchical organization of coarse-grained language-independent concepts, a set of near-synonyms is simply a set of words that all link to the same language-independent concept (DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede 1993; Hirst 1995). 
Since there is as yet no comprehensive theory of style, our approach is similar to past approaches, such as those of DiMarco and Hirst (1993), Stede (1993), and Hovy (1988). 
In general, near-synonyms can differ with respect to any aspect of their meaning (Cruse 1986):  denotational variations, in a broad sense, including propositional, fuzzy, and other peripheral aspects  stylistic variations, including dialect and register  expressive variations, including emotive and attitudinal aspects  structural variations, including collocational, selectional, and syntactic variations Building on an earlier analysis by DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede (1993) of the types of differentiae used in synonym discrimination dictionaries, Edmonds (1999) classifies near-synonymic variation into 35 subcategories within the four broad categories above.

Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth (2000) evaluated Rooth et al.s (1999) EM-based clustering model again using pseudodisambiguation, but on a separate data set using a Table 13 Percentage of correct disambiguations on the pseudodisambiguation task using Web counts and counts re-created using EM-based clustering (Rooth et al. 1999). 
Verb classes have proved useful in various (multilingual) natural language processing (NLP) tasks and applications, such as computational lexicography (Kipper et al. , 2000), language generation (Stede, 1998), machine translation (Dorr, 1997), word sense disambiguation (Prescher et al. , 2000), document classi cation (Klavans and Kan, 1998), and subcategorization acquisition (Korhonen, 2002). 
In this manner, we define the probability of a3a24a7a25a1a10a3 a11 a12a14a3 a15 a5 a20 a26 a11a28a27 a26 a15 as: a0a2a1a10a3a29a5a30a7 a31a33a32a35a34 a0a2a1 a19 a12a14a3a6a5a36a7 a31a33a32a37a34 a0a2a1 a19 a5a10a0a2a1a10a3a39a38 a19 a5 a7 a31a33a32a35a34 a0a2a1 a19 a5a4a0a18a1a4a3 a11 a38 a19 a5a4a0a2a1a10a3 a15 a38 a19 a5 Estimation was performed using a variant of the expectation-maximisation algorithm (Prescher et al. , 2000).

Up to now, such classifications have been used in applications such as word sense disambiguation (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Kohomban and Lee, 2005), machine translation (Prescher et al., 2000; Koehn and Hoang, 2007), document classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998), and in statistical lexical acquisition in general (Rooth et al., 1999; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Korhonen, 2002; Schulte im Walde, 2006).

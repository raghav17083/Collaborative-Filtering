The identification of the expected answer type is based either on binary semantic dependencies extracted from the syntactic parse of the question (Harabagiu et al. , 2001) or on the predicateargument structure of the question. 
Several important facts have emerged that could influence related research approaches: a0 a growing availability of lexical knowledge bases that model and structure words: WordNet (Miller 1995) and EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998) among others; some open-domain QA systems have proven the usefulness of these resources, e.g. WordNet in the system described in (Harabagiu et al. 2001). 
1996; Mendonca et al. , 2001). 
Questions are particularly important since a question parser is a component in most Question Answering (QA) systems (Harabagiu et al., 2001). 
2 Related Work QA has approached the problem of the lexical gap by various techniques for question reformulation, including rule-based syntactic and semantic reformulation patterns (Hermjakob et al. , 2002), reformulations based on shared dependency parses (Lin and Pantel, 2001), or various uses of the WordNet ontology to close the lexical gap word-by-word (Hovy et al. , 2000; Prager et al. , 2001; Harabagiu et al. , 2001).

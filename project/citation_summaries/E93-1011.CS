A list of terms is associated with each corpus: the terms corresponding to \[ECI\] were automatically extracted by LEXTER (Bourigault, 1993) and the terms corresponding to \[AGR\] were extracted from the AGROVOC term list owned by INIST/CNRS. 
1 Computational Terminology In the domain of corpus-based terminology two types of tools are currently developed: tools for automatic term extraction (Bourigault, 1993; Justeson and Katz, 1995; Daille, 1996; Brun, 1998) and tools for automatic thesaurus construction (Grefenstette, 1994). 
2 Background and Introduction NLP techniques have been applied to extraction of information from corpora for tasks such as free indexing (extraction of descriptors from corpora), (Metzler and Haas, 1989; Schwarz, 1990; Sheridan and Smeaton, 1992; Strzalkowski, 1996), term acquisition (Smadja and McKeown, 1991; Bourigault, 1993; Justeson and Katz, 1995; Dallle, 1996), or extraction of lin9uistic information e.g. support verbs (Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995), and event structure of verbs (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992). 
With this aim in mind, we are currently investigating two novel research directions : firstly, a hybridisation of FASTR with a connectionist model dedicated to nominal composition (Jacquemin 1993) and, secondly, a cooperation between FASTR and LEXTER (Bourigault 1993) a tool for term acquisition through the filtering of part-of-speech patterns. 
We also thank the Institut de l'Information Scientifique et Technique (INIST-CNRS) for providing us with the agricultural corpus and the associated term list, and Didier Bourigault for providing us with terms extracted from the newspaper corpus through LEXTER (Bourigault, 1993).

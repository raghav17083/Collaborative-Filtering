Linguistic salience modeling has been used for language interpretations such as reference resolution (Huls et al. , 1995; Eisenstein and Christoudias, 2004).


Most salience-based interpretation has focused on reference resolution for both linguistic referring expressions (e.g. , pronouns) (Lappin and Leass 1995) and multimodal expressions (Hul et al. 1995; Eisenstein and Christoudias 2004).

Extractive summarization is a simple but robust method for text summarization and it involves assigning saliency scores to some units (e.g. sentences, paragraphs) of the documents and extracting those with highest scores, while abstraction summarization usually needs information fusion (Barzilay et al., 1999), sentence compression (Knight and  Marcu, 2002) and reformulation (McKeown et al., 1999). 
For our evaluation cases, we use the Information Fusion data collected by [Barzilay et al. , 1999]. 
Because of this, it is generally accepted that some kind of postprocessing should be performed to improve the final result, by shortening, fusing, or otherwise revising the material (Grefenstette 1998; Mani, Gates, and Bloedorn 1999; Jing and McKeown 2000; Barzilay et al. 2000; Knight and Marcu 2000). 
The merging task is a more logic-based approach than similar techniques like information fusion used in multi-document summarization (Barzilay et al. , 1999). 
And researchers in multi-document text summarization (Barzilay et al. , 1999), information extraction (Shinyama et al. , 2002), and question answering (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Hermjakob et al. , 2002) have focused on identifying and exploiting paraphrases in the context of recognizing redundancies, alternative formulations of the same meaning, and improving the performance of question answering systems.

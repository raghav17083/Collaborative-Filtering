The resulting word similarity database can then be used to smooth the probability distribution in statistical language models (Dagan et al, 1997);  A clustering algorithm that constructs Roget-like semantic categories in an unsupervised fashion (Lin and Pantel, 2001a); and  An unsupervised learner to identify similar expressions from a parsed corpus (Lin and Pantel, 2001b). 
It was shown in (Dagan et al., 1997) that a similarity-based smoothing method achieved much better results than backoff smoothing methods in word sense disambiguation. 
Essentially there are different ways to estimate distributional similarity between two words (Dagan et al. , 1997), and the one we propose to use is confusion probability (Essen and Steinbiss, 1992). 
Similarity-based methods have also been successfully applied word sense disambiguation (Dagan et al. , 1997) and extraction of grammatical relations (Grishman and Sterling, 1994). 
Distributional similarity between words has been investigated and successfully applied in many natural language tasks such as automatic semantic knowledge acquisition (Dekang Lin, 1998) and language model smoothing (Essen and Steinbiss, 1992; Dagan et al. , 1997).

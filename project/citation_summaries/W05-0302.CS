6.3 Integrating PropBank and NomBank SRL Work in (Pustejovsky et al. , 2005) discussed the possibility of merging various Treebank annotation efforts including PropBank, NomBank, and others. 
1 Introduction Automatic Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) systems, made possible by the availability of PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2003; Palmer et al. , 2005), and encouraged by evaluation efforts in (Carreras and Marquez, 2005; Litkowski, 2004), have been shown to accurately determine the argument structure of verb predicates. 
(McShane et al. , 2005) discusses the issue of human-aided annotation (human correction of a machine-generated analysis) as it pertains to a single-integrated annotation scheme, similar in many ways to Pie in the Sky, although it has been in existence for a lot longer. 
For NomBank SRL fea140 Baseline Features (Pradhan et al. , 2005) b1 predicate: stemmed noun b2 subcat: grammar rule that expands the predicates parent b3 phrase type: syntactic category of the constituent b4 head word: syntactic head of the constituent b5 path: syntactic path from the constituent to the predicate b6 position: to the left or right of the predicate b11 first or last word/POS spanned by the constituent (b11FW, b11LW, b11FP, b11LP) b12 phrase type of the left or right sister (b12L, b12R) b13 left or right sisters head word/POS (b13LH, b13LP, b13RH, b13RP) b14 phrase type of parent b15 parents head word or its POS (b15H, b15P) b16 head word of the constituent if its parent has phrase type PP b17 head word or POS tag of the rightmost NP node, if the constituent is PP (b17H, b17P) b18 phrase type appended with the length of path b19 temporal keyword, e.g., Monday b20 partial path from the constituent to the lowest common ancestor with the predicate b21 projected path from the constituent to the highest NP dominating the predicate Baseline Combined Features (Xue and Palmer, 2004) b31 b1 & b3 b32 b1 & b4 b33 b1 & b5 b34 b1 & b6 Table 1: Baseline features for NomBank SRL tures, we use this set of more specific mappings to replace the morphological mappings based on WordNet. 
We are also considering experiments with parsers tailored to particular genres and/or parsers that add function tags (Harper et al., 2005).

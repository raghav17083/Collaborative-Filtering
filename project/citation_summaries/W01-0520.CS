(Bangalore et al. , 2001) experimentally determine how the quality and quantity of the resources used in training FERGUS a ect the output quality of the generator. 
Two kinds of TAG grammar are used in (Bangalore et al. , 2001). 
But (Bangalore et al. , 2001) show that automatically generated version of these resources can be used by FERGUS to obtain quality output. 
Two kinds of treebank are used in (Bangalore et al. , 2001). 
The best result is obtained by using HH to train both the TM and the LM; this result (0.41) is comparable to the result obtained by using matched PTB training and test data (0.43) that is used in (Bangalore et al. , 2001).

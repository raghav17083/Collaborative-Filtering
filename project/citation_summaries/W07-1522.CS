3 Experiments 3.1 Experimental Settings Corpora: We used the NAIST Text Corpus version 1.4b (Iida et al., 2007) and the Kyoto Text Corpus 4.0 as the annotated corpora. 
6.1 Data set In this experiment, we take the ellipsis of nominative arguments of predicates as target zeropronouns because they are most frequently omitted in Japanese, for example, 45.5% of the nominative arguments of predicates are omitted in the NAIST Text Corpus (Iida et al., 2007b). 
On the other hand, the existing machine learning-based methods (Aone and Bennett, 1995; McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Seki et al., 2002; Isozaki and Hirao, 2003; Iida et al., 2005; Iida et al., 2007a, etc.) have been developed with less attention given to such a problem. 
4 Experimental Results 4.1 Experimental Setting We performed our experiments using the NAIST Text Corpus 1.4 (Iida et al., 2007). 
In particular, for languages such as Japanese, anaphora resolution is crucial for resolving a phrase in a text to its referent since phrases, especially nominative arguments of predicates, are frequently omitted by anaphoric functions in discourse (Iida et al., 2007b).

Approaches evaluated so far make use of dictionaries with semantic annotation (Piao et al. , 2006), WordNet (Pearce, 2001), automatically generated thesauri (Lin, 1999; McCarthy et al. , 2003; Fazly and Stevenson, 2006), vector-based methods that measure semantic distance (Baldwin et al. , 2003; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006), translations extracted from parallel corpora (Villada Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006) or hybrid methods that use machine learning techniques informed by features coded using some of the above methods (Venkatapathy and Joshi, 2005).


Baldwin (2006) characterizes the idiosyncratic behavior of MWEs as ?a lack of compositionality manifest at different levels of analysis, namely, lexical, morphological, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and statistical??

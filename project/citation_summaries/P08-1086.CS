(Uszkoreit and Brants, 2008) used partially classbased LMs together with word-based LMs to improve SMT performance despite the large size of the word-based models used.


Uszkoreit and Brants (2008) proposed a 1030 distributed clustering algorithm with a similar objective function as the Brown algorithm.

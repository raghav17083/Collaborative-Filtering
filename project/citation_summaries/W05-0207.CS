Past research has addressed a variety of text-reuse applications, including: journalists turning a news agency text into a newspaper story (Clough et al. , 2002); editors adapting an encyclopedia entry to an abridged version (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003); and plagiarizers disguising their sources by removing surface similarities (Uzuner et al. , 2005).

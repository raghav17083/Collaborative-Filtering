TMs have been used for statistical machine translation (Berger et al. , 1996), word alignment of a translation corpus (Melamed, 2000), multilingual document retrieval (Franz et al. , 1999), automatic dictionary construction (Resnik and Melamed, 1997), and data preparation for word sense disambiguation programs (Brown et al. , 1991). 
Resnik & Melamed (1997) report that the model produced 494 translation lexicons with 94% precision and 30% recall, when trained on French/English software manuals totaling about 400,000 words. 
In other cases, they can be constructed automatically or semi-automatically using any of several methods (Fung, 1995; Melamed, 1996c; Resnik & Melamed, 1997). 
Using the same model but less data, a French/English software manual of 400,000 words, Resnik and Melamed (1997) reported 94% precision with 30% recall. 
1 Introduction String similarity metrics are extensively used in the processing of textual data for several purposes such as the detection and correction of spelling errors (Kukich, 1992), for sentence and word alignments (Church, 1993; Simard et al. , 1992; Melamed, 1995), and the extraction of information from monolingnal as well as multi-lingual text (Resnik and Melamed, 1997; Borin, 1998; Tiedemann, 1998a).

On the other hand, our approach is similar to the approaches of Siegel, and Lapata and Brew (1999), in attempting to learn semantic notions from distributions of 12 A baseline of 5% is reported, based on a closest-neighbor pairing of verbs, but it is not straightforward to compare this task to the proposed clustering algorithm. 
Related Work Levins (1993) seminal study on diathesis alternations and verb semantic classes has recently influenced work in dictionary creation (Dorr 1997; Dang et al. 1998; Dorr and Jones 1996) and notably lexicon acquisition on the basis of the assumption that verbal meaning can be gleaned from corpora using cues pertaining to syntactic structure (Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Schulte im Walde 2000; Lapata 1999; McCarthy 2000). 
In work on lexical semantic verb classification, Lapata and Brew (1999) further support the thesis of a predictive correlation between syntax and semantics in a statistical framework, showing that the frequency distributions of subcategorization frames within and across classes can disambiguate the usages of a verb with more than one known lexical semantic class. 
The different approaches (e.g. Brent, !991, 1993; Ushioda et al. , 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Manning, 1993; Carroll and Rooth, 1998; Gahl, 1998; Lapata, 1999; Sarkar and Zeman, 2000) vary largely according to the methods used and the number of SCFS being extracted. 
This is often termed as the classification of verb diathesis roles or the lexical semantics of predicates in natural language (see (Levin, 1993; McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999; Stevenson et al. , 1999; Lapata, 1999; Lapata and Brew, 1999; Schulte im Walde, 2000)).

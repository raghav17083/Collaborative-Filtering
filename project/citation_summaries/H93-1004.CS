Subjective metrics that have been used include (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995; Hirschman and Pao, 1993; Simpson and Fraser, 1993; Danieli et al. , 1992; Bernsen, Dybkjaer, and Dybkjaer, 1996) :  Implicitrecovery (IR): the system's ability to use dialog context to recover from errors of partial recognition or understanding. 
5 Effectiveness Comparison 5.1 English-Chinese ATIS Models Both the transfer and transducer systems were trained and evaluated on English-to-Mandarin Chinese translation of transcribed utterances from the ATIS corpus (Hirschman et al. 1993). 
In the Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) approach, a human wizard simulates the behavior of a program interacting with a human to carry out a particular task in a particular domain (Dahlb~ick and Jonsson 1989; Hirschman et al. 1993; Oviatt and Cohen 1989; Whittaker and Stenton 1989). 
For example, a dialog system can be evaluated by measuring the system's ability to help users achieve their goals, the system's robustness in detecting and recovering from errors of speech recognition or of understanding, and the overall quality of the system's interactions with users (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995; Hirschman and Pao, 1993; Polifroni et al. , 1992; Price et al. , 1992; Simpson and Fraser, 1993). 
3.3 Model Construction The head transducer model was trained and evaluated on English-to-Mandarin Chinese translation of transcribed utterances from the ATIS corpus (Hirschman et al. 1993).

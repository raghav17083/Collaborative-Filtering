Parsing methods for context-free grammar can be extended to unification-based grammar formalisms (see Shieber, 1985 or Haas, 1989), and therefore they can in principle be used to parse CUG. 
Comparing our results with those of Shieber (1985) and Haas (1989), we see that in all cases top-down filtering may reduce the size of the chart significantly. 
Some researchers (Haas, 1989; Torenvliet and Trautwein, 1995) conjecture that some of the OLP variants are undecidable (it is undecidable whether a grammar satis es the constraint), although none of them gives any proof of it. 
A uni cation grammar is depth-bounded iff for every a4a3a68a31a187 there is a a186a188a68a31a187 such that every parse tree for a sentential form of a4 symbols has depth less than a186 . According to Haas (1989), a depth-bounded grammar cannot build an unbounded amount of tree structure from a bounded number of symbols . Therefore, for each sentential form of lengtha95 there exist a nite number of partial derivation trees, guaranteeing parsing termination. 
Whereas Haas (1989) found that top-down filtering never helps to actually decrease parse times in a bottom-up parser, we have found at least one example (German) where top-down filtering is useful.

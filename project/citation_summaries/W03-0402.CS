Using SVMRank, (Shen and Joshi, 2003) achieved significant improvement on parse reranking. 
When compared to other kernel methods, our approach performs better than those based on the Tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Collins and Roark, 2004), and is only 0.2% worse than the best results achieved by a kernel method for parsing (Shen et al. , 2003; Shen and Joshi, 2004). 
To address this problem, we propose constructing the kernel from a probabilistic model which has been reparameterized to better suit 1In (Shen and Joshi, 2003) it was proposed to use an ensemble of SVMs trained the Wall Street Journal corpus, but we believe that the generalization performance of the resulting classifier is compromised in this approach. 
Shen and Joshi (2003) also used the preference kernel K(xi: ; xj: ) for reranking. 
SJ03 = linear kernel of (Shen and Joshi, 2003).

(Kay & Roscheisen 1993; and Chen 1993) used lexical information for sentence alignment. 
The statistical approach involves the following: alignment of bilingual texts at the sentence level nsing statistical techniques (e.g. Brown, Lai and Mercer (1991), Gale and Church (1993), Chen (1993), and Kay and RSscheisen (1993)), statistical machine translation models (e.g. Brown, Cooke, Pietra, Pietra et al. 
However, current sentence alignment models, (Brown et al 1991; Gale & Church 1991; Wu 1994; Chen 489 1993; Zhao and Vogel, 2002; etc).

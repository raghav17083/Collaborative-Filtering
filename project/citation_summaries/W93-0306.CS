1 Introduction In the part-of-speech hterature, whether taggers are based on a rule-based approach (Klein and Simmons, 1963), (Brill, 1992), (Voutilainen, 1993), or on a statistical one (Bahl and Mercer, 1976), (Leech et al. , 1983), (Merialdo, 1994), (DeRose, 1988), (Church, 1989), (Cutting et al. , 1992), there is a debate as to whether more attention should be paid to lexical probabilities rather than contextual ones. 
Figure 1: Base NP Examples base noun phrases with initial determiners and modifiers removed: Justeson & Katz (1995) look for repeated phrases; Bourigault (1992) uses a handcrafted noun phrase grammar in conjunction with heuristics for finding maximal length noun phrases; Voutilainen's NPTool (1993) uses a handcrafted lexicon and constraint grammar to find terminological noun phrases that include phrase-final prepositional phrases. 
However, the sample NPtool analysis given in the appendix of (Voutilainen, 1993), appears to be less accurate than claimed in general, with 5 apparent mistakes (and one unresolved ambiguity) out of the 32 NP chunks in that sample, as listed in Table 1. 
Much previous work has been done on this problem and many different methods have been used: Church's PARTS (1988) program uses a Markov model; Bourigault (1992) uses heuristics along with a grammar; Voutilainen's NPTool (1993) uses a lexicon combined with a constraint grammar; Juteson and Katz (1995) use repeated phrases; Veenstra (1998), Argamon, Dagan & Krymolowski(1998) and Daelemaus, van den Bosch & Zavrel (1999) use memory-based systems; Ramshaw & Marcus (In Press) and Cardie & Pierce (1998) use rule-based systems. 
Voutilainen (1993) announces NPtool for acquisition of maximal-length noun phrases.

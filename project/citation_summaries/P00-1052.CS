A sequence of two Rough Shift transitions in this short discourse is counterintuitive and unexpected given that of all centering transitions, Rough Shifts in particular have been shown to (a) disfavor pronominal reference (Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994; Di Eugenio 1998; and Miltsakaki 1999, among others), (b) be rare in corpora, to the extent that the transition has been ignored by some researchers (Di Eugenio 1998 and Hurewitz 1998, among others), and (c) be reliable measures of low coherence in student essays (Miltsakaki and Kukich 2000a). 
This supports previous findings that such types of transitions are associated with poorly written text and can be used to improve the accuracy of automatic grading of essays based on various non-discourse features (Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2000). 
The reader is referred, however, to Miltsakaki and Kukich (2000a, 2000b) for a discussion of the significance of Rough Shifts in the evaluation of text coherence. 
For instance, Miltsakaki and Kukich (2000) annotate a corpus of student essays with transition information, and show that the distribution of transitions correlates with human grades. 
We follow Miltsakaki and Kukich (2000) in assuming that our unit of analysis is the traditional sentence (i.e. , a main clause with accompanying subordinate and adjunct clauses).

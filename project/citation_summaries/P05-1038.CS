So (Arun and Keller, 2005) conclude that since lexicalization helps much more for parsing French, with a flat annotation, then word-order flexibility is the key-factor that makes lexicalization useful (if word order is fixed, cf. 
Collins (1997)s parser and its reimplementation and extension by Bikel (2002) have by now been applied to a variety of languages: English (Collins, 1999), Czech (Collins et al. , 1999), German (Dubey and Keller, 2003), Spanish (Cowan and Collins, 2005), French (Arun and Keller, 2005), Chinese (Bikel, 2002) and, according to Dan Bikels web page, Arabic. 
The bestreported F1 constituency scores from this work for each language are 79.9% (Chinese (Chiang and Bikel, 2002)), 81.0% (French (Arun and Keller, 2005), 76.2% (German (Dubey, 2005)), and 73.8% (Spanish (Moreno et al. , 2000)). 
For instance, work has been done in Chinese using the Penn Chinese Treebank (Levy and Manning, 2003; Chiang and Bikel, 2002), in Czech using the Prague Dependency Treebank (Collins et al. , 1999), in French using the French Treebank (Arun and Keller, 2005), in German using the Negra Treebank (Dubey, 2005; Dubey and Keller, 2003), and in Spanish using the UAM Spanish Treebank (Moreno et al. , 2000).

hnplementations of this idea use word stem repetition (Youmans, 1991; Reynar, 1994; Ponte and Croft, 1997), context vectors (Hearst, 1994; Yaari, 1997; Kaufmann, 1999; Eichmann et al. , 1999), entity repetition (Kan et al. , 1998), semantic similarity (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Kozima, 1993), word distance model (Beeferman et al. , 1997a) and word frequency model (Reynar, 1999) to detect cohesion. 
This data was used by Choi (2000) to compare various domain-independent text segmentation systems.6 He evaluated a133a26a186a62a186 (Choi, 2000), TextTiling (Hearst, 1994), DotPlot (Reynar, 1998), and Segmenter (Kan et al. , 1998) by using the data and reported that a133a26a186a180a186 achieved the best performance among these systems. 
Optimization is the algorithm we proposed in (Reynar, 1994). 
Reynar (1994) presented a method that finds topically similar regions in the text by graphically modeling the distribution 32 Ttir, Hakkani-Tiir, Stolcke, and Shriberg Integrating Prosodic and Lexical Cues of word repetitions. 
Some evaluations circumvent this difficulty by detecting boundaries in sets of concatenated documents, where there can be no disagreements about the fact of the matter (Reynar 1994; Choi 2000); others have several human judges make ratings to produce a gold standard. The second difficulty with evaluating these algorithms is that for different applications of text segmentation, different kinds of errors become important.

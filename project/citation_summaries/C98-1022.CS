Bod 1992, 1995; Bod & Kaplan 1998; Scha 1992; Sima'an 1995, 1997; Rajman 1995) is a probabilistic parsing model which does not single out a narrowly predefined set of structures as the statistically significant ones. 
This paper presents ongoing work on DOP models for Lexical-Functional Grammar representations, known as LFG-DOP (Bod & Kaplan 1998). 
According to Bod & Kaplan (1998), Discard-generated fragments are needed to parse sentences that are "ungrammatical with respect to the corpus", thus increasing the robustness of the model. 
But the model has also been applied to several other grammatical frameworks, e.g. Tree-Insertion Grammar (Hoogweg 2000), Tree-Adjoining Grammar (Neumann 1998), Lexical-Functional Grammar (Bod & Kaplan 1998; Cormons 1999), Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Neumann & Flickinger 1999), and Montague Grammar (Bonnema et al. 1997; Bod 1999). 
In defining a DOP model for LFG representations, Bod & Kaplan (1998) give the following settings for DOP's four parameters.

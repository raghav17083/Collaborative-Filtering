Recently, a knowledge-based algorithm for Word Sense Disambiguation, called Structural Semantic Interconnections1 (SSI) (Navigli and Velardi, 2004), has been shown to provide interesting insights into the choice of word senses by providing structural justifications in terms of semantic graphs. 
Details are found in (Navigli and Velardi, 2004) and (Navigli, Velardi and Gangemi, 2003). 
OntoLearn (Navigli and Velardi, 2004) extracts domain terminology from a collection of texts using a syntactic parse to identify candidate terms that are filtered based on domain relevance and connected using a semantic interpretation based on word sense disambiguation. 
The availability of widecoverage computational lexicons like WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), as well as semantically annotated corpora like SemCor (Miller et al. 1993), has certainly contributed to the exploration and exploitation of semantic graphs for several tasks like the analysis of lexical text cohesion (Morris and Hirst 1991), word sense disambiguation (Agirre and Rigau 1996; Mihalcea and Moldovan 2001), and ontology learning (Navigli and Velardi 2004), etc. Recently, a knowledge-based algorithm for word sense disambiguation called structural semantic interconnections (SSI, http://lcl.di.uniroma1.it/ssi) (Navigli and Velardi 2004, 2005), has been shown to provide interesting insights into the choice of word senses by providing structural justifications in terms of semantic graphs. 
This pattern (an instance of the gloss+hypeonymyr/meronymy rule) cumulates 4 We remark again that a detailed description of the SSI algorithm is in (Navigli & Velardi, 2004) and (Navigli, Velardi and Gangemi, 2003).

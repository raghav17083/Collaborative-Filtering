Both of Nivres algorithms assume projectivity, but the MaltParser supports pseudo-projective parsing (Nilsson et al., 2007), for projectivization and deprojectivization.


Nilsson et al. tried to transform the tree representation of a treebank into a more suitable representation for data-driven dependency parsers (Nilsson et al., 2006; Nilsson et al., 2007).

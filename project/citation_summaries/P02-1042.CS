We use Clark et al.s parser to generate these dependencies from the output of our parser (see Clark and Hockenmaier (2002)) 4 .

1 Introduction A number of statistical parsing models have recently been developed for Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; Steedman, 2000) and used in parsers applied to the WSJ Penn Treebank (Clark et al. , 2002; Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002; Hockenmaier, 2003b). 
The parsing algorithm was CKY-style parsing with beam thresholding, which was similar to ones used in (Collins, 1996; Clark et al. , 2002). 
2.3 Dependency structures A disambiguation model for wide-coverage CCG (Clark et al. , 2002) aims at representing deep linguistic dependencies including long-distance dependencies and control relations. 
Following recent research about disambiguation models on linguistic grammars (Abney, 1997; Johnson et al. , 1999; Riezler et al. , 2002; Clark and Curran, 2003; Miyao et al. , 2003; Malouf and van Noord, 2004), we apply a log-linear model or maximum entropy model (Berger et al. , 1996) on HPSG derivations.

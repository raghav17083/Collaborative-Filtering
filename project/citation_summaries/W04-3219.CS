For instance, (Quirk et al., 2004) used a phrase-based SMT decoder that uses local paraphrases acquired from comparable corpora to produce monotone sentential paraphrases. 
Especially, in sentence paraphrase generation, this type of paraphrasepatternscanreorderthephrasesinasentence, which can hardly be achieved by the conventional MT-based generation method (Quirk et al., 2004). 
2 Related Work To model the syntactic transformation process, researchers in these fieldsespecially in machine translationhave developed powerful grammatical formalisms and statistical models for representing and learning these tree-to-tree relations (Wu and Wong, 1998; Eisner, 2003; Gildea, 2003; Melamed, 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al. , 2005; Galley et al. , 2006; Smith and Eisner, 2006, inter alia). 
Another piece of related work, (Quirk et al. , 2004), starts off with parallel inputs and uses monolingual Statistical Machine Translation techniques to align them and generate novel sentences. 
g2 2 Motivation The success of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) has sparked a successful line of investigation that treats paraphrase acquisition and generation essentially as a monolingual machine translation problem (e.g. , Barzilay & Lee, 2003; Pang et al. , 2003; Quirk et al. , 2004; Finch et al. , 2004).

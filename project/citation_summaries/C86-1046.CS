Dependency Unification Grammar (DUG, Hellwig (1986)) defines a tree-like data structure for the representation of syntactic analyses. 
A dependency theory of syntactic structure indicates syntactic relations directly between the words of a sentence ((e.g. , Hays, 1964; Hudson, 1976, Hellwig, 1986; Mel'chuk, 1988; Robinson, 1970; Schubert, 1986; Starosta, 1988).

There are already applications that utilize such knowledge (e.g., (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005) for textual entailment). 
Recently, Tatu and Moldovan (2005) have shown that semantic relations such as partwhole can be combined with other relations using a semantic calculus for the purpose of improving the performance of a textual inference system. 
This is problematic for the use of FrameNet analyses as a basis for inferences over text, as e.g. in Tatu and Moldovan (2005). 
This is partly due to its relevance for applications ranging from information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003; Moschittietal., 2003)toquestionanswering(Shenand Lapata, 2007), paraphrase identification (Pado and Erk, 2005), and the modeling of textual entailment relations (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005). 
Many previous approaches have used a logical form representation of the text and hypothesis sentences, focusing on deriving a proof by which one can infer the hypothesis logical form from the text logical form (Bayer et al. , 2005; Bos and Markert, 2005; Raina et al. , 2005; Tatu and Moldovan, 2005).

5.2 Features Cue phrases: previous work on segmentation has found that discourse particles like now, well provide valuable information about the structure of texts (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Hirschberg and Litman, 1994; Passonneau and Litman, 1997). 
Most of the algorithmic research in discourse segmentation focused on segments of coarse granularity (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Passonneau and Litman, 1997; Hearst, 1997; Yaari, 1997). 
By using multiple markers and machine learning methods, topic segmentation algorithms may be developed using this second approach that have a higher accuracy than methods using a single marker alone (Passonneau and Litman, 1997). 
Preliminary studies indicate that reliability for human tagging is higher for AVM attribute tagging than for other types of discourse segment tagging (Passonneau and Litman, 1997; Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). 
Most of those that achieve text segmentation only rely on the intrinsic characteristics of texts: word distribution, as in (Hearst, 1997), (Choi, 2000) and (Utiyama and Isahara, 2001), or linguistic cues as in (Passonneau and Litman, 1997).

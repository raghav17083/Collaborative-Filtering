A frequently occurring phrase, especially at the beginning of a defirtition, is often a "defining formula" (Smith 1985, Ahlswede and Evens 1987) that marks a relation. 
The recognized necessity to describe the concept lexicon prior to dealing with natural languages is a feature which clearly distinguishes our approach from Computational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1987 277 Sergei Nirenburg and Victor Raskin The Subworld Concept Lexicon and the Lexicon Management System other work on lexical aids (e.g. , Ahlswede 1985) and brings us closer to some non-NL work on knowledge acquisition (e.g. , Lenat et al. 1986). 
We have parsed W7 adjective definitions (Ahlswede, 1985b) using Sager's Linguistic String Parser (Sager, 1981) in order to automatically identify lexical-semantic relations associated with defining formulae. 
The work in lexicon has centered on a) studies concerned with the utilization of conventional humanoriented dictionaries, newly available in machine-readable form, for computational tasks (e.g. , Amsler 1984a,b; Chodorow et al. 1985; Ahlswede 1985; Markowitz et al. 1986) improving the ancillary capabilities for lexicon systems, such as, for instance, morphological processors and descriptions (e.g. , Nirenburg and Ben Asher 1984; Byrd et al. 1986; Boguraev et al. 1987); c) hand-building of lexicons necessary for natural language systems, often with considerations about extensibility (e.g. , Zernik and Dyer 1985; Bessemer and Jacobs 1987). 
Some of the defining formulae discussed in Smith (1981) and Ahlswede (1985b) seem to be limited to statlve adjectives.

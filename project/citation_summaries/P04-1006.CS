The Charniak parsing pipeline has been extensively studied over the past decade, with a number of papers focused on improving early stages of the pipeline (Charniak et al. , 1998; Caraballo and Charniak, 1998; Blaheta and Charniak, 1999; Hall and Johnson, 2004; Charniak et al. , 2006) as well as many focused on optimizing final parse accuracy (Charniak, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; McClosky et al. , 2006). 
However, internalheuristicsoftheCharniak search, such as attention shifting (Blaheta and Charniak, 1999; Hall and Johnson, 2004), can make this accuracy/efficiency tradeoff somewhat difficult to interpret. 
Related approaches are used in Hall (2004) and Charniak and Johnson (2005). 
Model WER Charniak Parser (Charniak, 2001) 11.8 Attention Shifting 11.9 (Hall and Johnson, 2004) PCFG (Hall, 2005) 12.0 A* decoding (Xu et al., 2002) 12.3 N-best word graph (this study) 12.6 PCFG (Roark, 2001) 12.7 PCFG (Hall and Johnson, 2004) 13.0 40m-word trigram 13.7 (Hall and Johnson, 2003) PCFG (Hall and Johnson, 2003) 15.5 5 Conclusions The primary aim of this research was to propose a new and efficient method for integrating an SR system with an MT system employing a chart parser. 
Incorporating syntactic features into the context has been at the forefront of recent research (Collins et al. , 2005; Rosenfeld et al. , 2001; Chelba and Jelinek, 2000; Hall and Johnson, 2004).

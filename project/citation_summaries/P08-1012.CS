This is in line with earlier work on consistent estimation for similar models (Zollmann and Simaan, 2006), and agrees with the most up-to-date work that employs Bayesian priors over the estimates (Zhang et al., 2008). 
Following the broad shift in the field from finite state transducers to grammar transducers (Chiang, 2007), recent approaches to phrase-based alignment have used synchronous grammar formalisms permitting polynomial time inference (Wu, 1997; 783 Cherry and Lin, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008b; Blunsom et al., 2008). 
The machine translation literature is littered with various attempts to learn a phrase-based string transducer directly from aligned sentence pairs, doing away with the separate word alignment step (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Cherry and Lin, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008b; Blunsom et al., 2008). 
It differs from (Zhang et al., 2008) in that it does postulate a latent segmentation variable and puts the prior directly over that variable rather than over the ITG synchronous rule estimates. 
In this work we draw on recent advances in Bayesian modelling of grammar induction (Johnson et al., 2007; Cohn et al., 2009) to propose a non-parametric model of synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG), continuing a recent trend in SMT to seek principled probabilistic formulations for heuristic translation models (Zhang et al., 2008; DeNero et al., 2008; Blunsom et al., 2009b; Blunsom et al., 2009a).

For example, aspects of a digital camera could include picture quality, battery life, size, color, value, etc. Finding such aspects is a challenging research problem that has been addressed in a number of ways (Hu and Liu, 2004b; Gamon et al., 2005; Carenini et al., 2005; Zhuang et al., 2006; Branavan et al., 2008; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008; Titov and McDonald, 2008b; Titov and McDonald, 2008a). 
To alleviate this information overload, research on systems that automatically aggregate and summarize opinions have been gaining interest (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Hu and Liu, 2004b; Gamon et al., 2005; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Carenini et al., 2005; Carenini et al., 2006; Zhuang et al., 2006; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008). 
Instead of the flat structure of a surface string, the parser provides a hierarchical representation, which we call a linguistic frame (Xu et al., 2008). 
This method is common among sentiment analysis systems (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008). 
Furthermore, there is evidence that rater agreement is much higher in preference decisions than in value judgments (Ariely et al., 2008).

Although some early systems for web-page analysis induce rules at character-level (e.g., such as WIEN (Kushmerick et al., 1997) and DIPRE (Brin, 1998)), most recent approaches for set expansion have used either tokenized and/or parsed free-text (Carlson et al., 2009; Talukdar et al., 2006; Snow et al., 2006; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006), or have incorporated heuristics for exploiting HTML structures that are likely to encode lists and tables (Nadeau et al., 2006; Etzioni et al., 2005). 
6 Related Work and Discussion There are several studies that used automatically extracted gazetteers for NER (Shinzato et al., 2006; Talukdar et al., 2006; Nadeau et al., 2006; Kazama and Torisawa, 2007). 
As in Talukdar?s approach (Talukdar et al. , 2006), we expect patterns to provide high precision. 
Since building and maintaining high-quality gazetteers by hand is very expensive, many methods have been proposed for automatic extraction of gazetteers from texts (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Etzioni et al., 2005; Shinzato et al., 2006; Talukdar et al., 2006; Nadeau et al., 2006). 
(2006) constructed gazetteers with about 100,000 entries in total for the restaurant domain; Talukdar et al.

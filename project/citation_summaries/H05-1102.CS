The LTAG-spinal formalism was initially proposed for automatic treebank extraction and statistical parsing (Shen and Joshi, 2005). 
The accuracy on LTAG dependency is 90.5%, which is 1.2 points over 89.3%, the previous best result (Shen and Joshi, 2005) on the same data set. 
This algorithm and its many variants are widely used in the computational linguistics community (Collins, 2002a; Collins and Duffy, 2002; Collins, 2002b; Collins and Roark, 2004; Henderson and Titov, 2005; Viola and Narasimhan, 2005; Cohen et al., 2004; Carreras et al., 2005; Shen and Joshi, 2005; Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003). 
Thus, the partial trees output by these systems were merged with the parse trees returned by Charniaks parser (second line, PropBank column).3 These results jointly confirm our initial hypothe1(Shen and Joshi, 2005) use PropBank labels to extract LTAG spinal trees to train an incremental LTAG parser, but they do not parse PropBank. 
Our parser is very similar to the work of (Shen and Joshi, 2005).

SCF and DR: These more linguistically informed features are constructed based on the grammatical relations generated by the C&C CCG parser (Clark and Curran, 2007). 
A score in this range is thought to be near the upper bound when evaluating a CCG parser on GRs, since some loss is inherent in the mapping to GRs (Clark and Curran, 2007a). 
However, their dependency-based evaluation does not make use of the grammatical function labels, which are provided in the corpora and closely correspond to the representations used in recent work on formalismindependent evaluation of parsers (e.g., Clark and Curran, 2007).3 Addressing these issues, we resolve the apparent discrepancy between Kubler et al. 
1 Introduction Recently, there have been advancement made in the parsing techniques for large-scale lexicalized grammars (Clark and Curran, 2004; Ninomiya et al., 2005; Ninomiya et al., 2007), and it have presumably been accelerated by the development of the semi-automatic acquisition techniques of large-scale lexicalized grammars from parsed corpora (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007; Miyao c2008. 
5 Experiments Our experiments are run with the C&C CCG parser (Clark and Curran, 2007b), and will evaluate the changes made to CCGbank, as well as the effectiveness of the NER features.

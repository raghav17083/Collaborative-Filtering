96 Research on DA classification initially focused on two-party conversational speech (Mast et al. , 1996; Stolcke et al. , 1998; Shriberg et al. , 1998) and, more recently, has extended to multi-party audio recordings like the ICSI corpus (Shriberg et al. , 2004). 
(2004), for example, might access the email signature zone, while tools that attempt to identify tasks or action items in email (e.g., (Bellotti et al., 2003; Corston-Oliver et al., 2004; Bennett and Carbonell, 2007; Lampert et al., 2007)) might restrict themselves to the sender-authored and forwarded content. 
(Shriberg et al. , 2004) As these DA annotations do not correspond one-to-one with utterances in the ICSI corpus, we align them in the most liberal way possible, i.e., if at least one word in an utterance is annotated for a particular DA, we mark the entirety of that utterance as exhibiting that DA. 
SVMs have been successfully applied to the task of extracting action items from email messages (Bennett and Carbonell, 2005; CorstonOliver et al. , 2004). 
The creation of the ICSI corpus (Janin et al. , 2003), comprised of 72 hours of meeting recordings with an average of 6 speakers per meeting, with associated transcripts, has spurred further annotations for various types of information, including dialog acts (Shriberg et al. , 2004), topic hierarchies and action items (Gruenstein et al. , 2005), and hot spots (Wrede and Shriberg, 2003).

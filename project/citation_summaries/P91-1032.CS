More recently, Pereira and Wright (1991) developed formal methods of approximating context-free grammars with finitestate grammars, s Thus, for practical purposes, computationally simple finite-state grammars can be utilized to adequately model natural language. 
In many useful cases, including the example grammar provided by Pereira and Wright (1991), this stack bound is never reached and the system reports that the FSA it returns is exact. 
Unlike the method derived from the LR(k) parsing algorithm described in Pereira and Wright (1991), these methods use grammar transformations based on the left-corner grammar transform (Rosenkrantz and Lewis II, 1970; Aho and Ulhnan, 1972). 
We will be interested in this paper in sound approximations (Pereira and Wright 1991) in which the language accepted by the approximation is a superset of language accepted by the original grammar. 
FSTs may also be used to parse restricted classes of context-free grammars (Pereira 1991; Roche 1994; Laporte 1996).

However, if combined with other inexact pruning techniques like beam-pruning (Goodman, 1997) or coarse-to-fine parsing (Charniak et al., 2006), binarization may interact with those pruning methods in a complicated way to affect parsing accuracy. 
One effective approach is coarse-to-fine pruning, in which a small, coarse grammar is used to prune edges in a large, refined grammar (Charniak et al., 2006). 
The Charniak parsing pipeline has been extensively studied over the past decade, with a number of papers focused on improving early stages of the pipeline (Charniak et al. , 1998; Caraballo and Charniak, 1998; Blaheta and Charniak, 1999; Hall and Johnson, 2004; Charniak et al. , 2006) as well as many focused on optimizing final parse accuracy (Charniak, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; McClosky et al. , 2006). 
Proper non-equivalent encodings are used to generalize the grammar and prevent the binarized grammar becoming too specific (Charniak et al., 2006). 
For example, in monolingual parsing, posterior pruning methods (Goodman, 1997; Charniak et al., 2006; Petrov and Klein, 2007) have led to greater speedups than their more cautious A* analogues (Klein and Manning, 2003; Haghighi et al., 2007), though at the cost of guaranteed optimality.

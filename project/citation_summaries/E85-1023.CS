These kinds of considerations fit nicely inside a probabilistic formulation of the problem (Beale 1985; Garside and Leech 1985), which offers the following advantages:  a sound theoretical framework is provided  the approximations are clear  the probabilities provide a straightforward way to disambiguate  the probabilities can be estimated automatically from data.

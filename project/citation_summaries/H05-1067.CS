Computational approaches to humor recognition so far primarily rely on lexical and stylistic cues such as alliteration, antonyms, adult slang (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005). 
They are also useful for detecting humor (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005), as satire and jokes tend to have contradictions and oxymorons. 
Tasks under this heading include computational humor (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005), genre classification (Boese and Howe, 2005), authorship attribution (Argamon and Shimoni, 2003), and metaphor detection (Krishnakumaran and Zhu, 2007), among others (Mishne et al., 2007; Mihalcea and Liu, 2006). 
Other models in computation have attempted to generate jokes using templates (Attardo and Raskin, 1994; Binsted and Ritchie, 1997) or recognize jokes using machine learning models (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005). 
Nonetheless, recent studies have shown a feasibility of automatically recognizing (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005) (Taylor and Mazlack, 2004) and generating (Binsted and Ritchie, 1997) (Stock and Strapparava, 2005) humor in computer systems.

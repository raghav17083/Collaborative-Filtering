Single Cue Phrase Studies Our first study of cue phrase disambiguation investigated multispeaker usage of the cue phrase now in a recorded, transcribed radio call-in program (Hirschberg and Litman 1987). 
4.4 Hypothesizing Discourse Acts by Chaining Our process model starts with the semantic representation of a new utterance and uses plan inference rules (Allen and Perrault 1980; Carberry 1988) along with constraint satisfaction (Litman and Allen 1987) to hypothesize chains of actions A1,A2 An that the speaker might be intending to perform with the utterance. 
A number of researchers (Reichman 1978, 1985; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Polanyi 1986; Cohen 1987; Hirschberg and Litman 1987; Litman and Allen 1987; Schiffrin 1987; Hinkelman 1989; Litman and Hirschberg 1990; Knott and Dale 1994; Knott and Mellish 1996; Marcu 1997) have investigated the use in discourse of special words and phrases such as but, anyway, and by the way. 
Litman and Hirschberg (1990) leave the analysis of cue phrase function to the interpretation of various specific discourse approaches and instead focus on validating their (1987) prosodic model of cue phrase use with additional data from monologue. 
Hirschberg and Litman (1987) and Litman and Hirschberg (1990) also examine the relation between discourse and prosodic phrasing.

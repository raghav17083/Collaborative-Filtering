The inference module, however, can be complemented by disambiguation using co-occurrence information (Park and Cho, 2000) and disambiguation of domaindependent word senses with consideration for the context-dependent information such as information structure (Steedman, 2000). 
(Park and Cho, 2000; Lee et al. , 1999) proposed to use the co-occurrence information during parsing and lexical selection. 
Since it is difficult to disambiguate the senses only with database information, we may utilize co-occurrence information between the collocated words such as (old,shoes) and (old,car) (Park and Cho, 2000; Lee et al. , 1999). 
2.5 Related Work Other ways of improving parsing accuracy with respect to coordination include learning patterns of morphological and semantical information for the conjuncts (Park and Cho, 2000). 
In this paper, we propose a disambiguation method with the database information and cooccurrence information (Park and Cho, 2000; Palmer et al. , 1999) for the interpretation of natural language queries (Lee and Park, 2001) in multilingual query interpretation.

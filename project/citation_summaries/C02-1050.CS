It should be noted that our results differ from those of (Watanabe and Sumita, 2002) for English to Japanese translation, who observed gains when decoding in the reverse direction for this language pair. 
4.1 Word Order Typography Following (Watanabe and Sumita, 2002), to explain the effects we observe in our results we look to the word order typography of the target language (Comrie and Vogel, 2000). 
In (Watanabe and Sumita, 2002) only one language pair is considered, for our experiments we extended this to include translation among 17 different languages including the Japanese and English pair used in (Watanabe and Sumita, 2002). 
In earlier work (Watanabe and Sumita, 2002), it was hypothesized that the optimal direction for decoding was dependent on the characteristics of the target language. 
This work is closely related to the techniques proposed in (Watanabe and Sumita, 2002), but in our case we decode within the framework of a phrase-based SMT system, rather than the IBM model.

Such a model is equivalent to a dynamic processing model of a tree-like structure reflecting the hierarchical nesting of discourse segments, and thus has significant similarities to discourse structure trees produced Ib/o RST (see Moser and Moore (1996)). 
Preliminary accounts are given in Grosz and Sidner [1990] and Moser and Moore [1996]. 
Other researchers have shown that Grosz and Sidner's model of discourse structure (GST) and RST are similar in many respects \[(Moser and Moore, 1996), (Marcu, 1999)\]. 
Moore and Pollack (1992), Moser and Moore (1996), and Reichman (1985) argue that trees are insufficient for representing informational, intentional, and attentional discourse structure. 
The sometimes competing informational and intentional roles of discourse segments have been at the centre of the debate over the nucleus-satellite distinction (Moore and Pollack, 1992; Moser and Moore, 1996; Bateman and Rondhius, 1997); the accessibility of discourse segments on the right frontier of a discourse structure is a phenomenon that has already been discussed by several researchers (Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993).

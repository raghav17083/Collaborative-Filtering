In this paper we address this issue, describing an experiment with an existing wide-coverage statistical grammar and parser for English (Carroll & Briscoe, 1996) in conjunction with subcategorisation frequencies acquired from 10 million words of text from the British National Corpus (BNC; Leech, 1992). 
3.1 Data The data used for all our experimental work was noun-verb direct-object data extracted from the BNC by a Robust Accurate Statistical Parser (RASP) (Briscoe and Carroll 1995; Carroll and Briscoe 1996). 
We contend that information about how functional relations are actually instantiated in a text is important for the following reasons:  it is linguistically valuable, both as an end in itself and as an intermediate linguistic resource; in fact, it is sufficiently close to semantic representations to be used as an intermediate stage of analysis in systems requiring full text understanding capabilities; 39  it is likely to become a more and more heavily used information asset in its own right for NLP applications: a shift of emphasis from purely pattern matching methods operating on n-word windows to functional information about word pairs has recently been witnessed both in the context of information retrieval/filtering systems (Grefenstette, 1994) and for the purposes of word sense disambiguation (see the last SENSEVAL and ROMANSEVAL evaluation campaigns);  it is comparatively easy and "fair" to evaluate since it overcomes some of the shortcomings of constituency-based evaluation (Carroll and Briscoe, 1996; Carroll et al. , 1998; Sampson, 1998; Lin, 1998);  it represents a very informative "lowest common ground" of a variety of different syntactic annotation schemes (Lin, 1998);  it is naturally multi-lingual, as functional relations probably represent the most significant level of syntactic analysis at which crosslanguage comparability makes sense;  it permits joint evaluation of systems dealing with both spoken and written language. 
This idea naturally contrasts to the idea of robust broad-coverage parsing (Carroll and Briscoe, 1996), in which a single grammar should be prepared for parsing of any kind of text. 
In our own experiments with grammatical relation data extracted by a Robust Accurate Statistical Parser (RASP) (Briscoe and Carroll 1995; Carroll and Briscoe 1996) from the British National Corpus (BNC), we found that 14% of noun-verb direct-object co-occurrence tokens and 49% of noun-verb direct-object co-occurrence types in one half of the data set were not seen in the other half.

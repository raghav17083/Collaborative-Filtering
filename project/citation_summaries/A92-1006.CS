These operations are not domain-specific and are similar to those of previous aggregation components (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992; Shaw, 1998; Danlos, 2000), although the various MERGE operations are, to our knowledge, novel in this form. 
The formalism could be extended to handle intrasentential syntactic effects, but inter-sentential discourse phenomena probably require procedural rules in order to access lexemes in The framework represents a generalization of several predecessor NLG systems based on Meaning-Text Theory: FoG (Kittredge and Polgu~re, 1991), LFS (Iordanskaja et al. , 1992), and JOYCE (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992). 
5.1 VPE in the Generation Architecture Tasks in the generation process have been divided into three stages (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992): the text planner has access only to information about communicative goals, the discourse context, and semantics, and generates a non-linguistic representation of text structure and content. 
3 Exemplar Library An exemplar (Rainbow et al., 1998; White and Caldwell, 1998) is a type of schema (McKeown, 1985; Rambow and Korelsky, 1992) whose purpose is to determine, for a given presentation request, tile general specification of the presentation regarding its macro-structure, its content and its format. 
The clause-combining operations are general operations similar to aggregation operations used in other research (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992; Danlos, 2000).

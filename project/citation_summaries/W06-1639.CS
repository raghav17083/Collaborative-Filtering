5 Related Work Evidence from the surrounding context has been used previously to determine if the current sentence should be subjective/objective (Riloff et al., 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004)) and adjacency pair information has been used to predict congressional votes (Thomas et al., 2006). 
Furthermore, these systems have tackled the problem at different levels of granularity, from the document level (Pang et al. , 2002), sentence level (Pang and Lee, 2004; Mao and Lebanon, 2006), phrase level (Turney, 2002; Choi et al. , 2005), as well as the speaker level in debates (Thomas et al. , 2006). 
In (Thomas et al. , 2006), the authors use the transcripts of debates from the US Congress to automatically classify speeches as supporting or opposing a given topic by taking advantage of the voting records of the speakers.

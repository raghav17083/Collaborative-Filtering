A weighted hypergraph also defines a probability or other weight for each tree, and can be used to represent the hypothesis space considered (for a given input) by a monolingual parser or a tree-based translation system, e.g., tree to string (Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006), string to tree (Galley et al., 2006), tree to tree (Eisner, 2003), or string to string with latent tree structures (Chiang, 2007). 
This is also true for reranking and discriminative training, where the k-best list of candidates serves as an approximation of the full set (Collins, 2000; Och, 2003; McDonald et al. , 2005). 
Semiring-weighted logic programming is a general framework to specify these algorithms (Pereira and Warren, 1983; Shieber et al., 1994; Goodman, 1999; Eisner et al., 2005; Lopez, 2009). 
Some stem from work on graphical models,includingloopybeliefpropagation(Suttonand McCallum, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2008), Gibbs sampling (Finkel et al., 2005), sequential Monte Carlo methods such as particle filtering (Levy et al., 2008), and variational inference (Jordan et al., 1999; MacKay, 1997; Kurihara and Sato, 2006). 
A first-order (or edge-factored) parsing model (McDonald et al., 2005) contains only LINK factors, along with a global TREE or PTREE factor.

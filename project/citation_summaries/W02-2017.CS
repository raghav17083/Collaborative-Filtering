Lin and Chen (2002) employed a machine learning approach to determine phonetic similarity scores for machine transliteration. 
Here are four reference translations taken from the same corpus, with mistakes underlined: Ref1 composers such as Bach, missing name Chopin, Beethoven, Shumann, Rakmaninov, Ravel and Prokoviev Ref2 musicians such as Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Bethoven, Shuman, Rachmaninoff, Rafael and Brokoviev Ref3 composers including Bach, Mozart, Schopen, Beethoven, missing name Raphael,Rahmaniev and Brokofien Ref4 composers such as Bach, Mozart, missing name Beethoven, Schumann, Rachmaninov, Raphael and Prokofiev The task of transliterating names (independent of end-to-end MT) has received a significant amount of research, e.g., (Knight and Graehl, 1997; Chen et al., 1998; Al-Onaizan, 2002). 
In the first experiment, we analyze the convergence characteristics of this model training based on a similarity-based framework (Chen et al. , 1998; Lin and Chen, 2002). 
The backward transliteration method proposed by Lin and Chen (2000, 2002) was followed to select the most similar English named entity and the related documents at the same time. 
Recently, much research has been done on machine transliteration for many language pairs, such as English/Arabic (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002), English/Chinese (Chen et al. , 1998; Lin and Chen, 2002; Wan and Verspoor, 1998), English/Japanese (Knight and Graehl, 1998), and English/Korean (Lee and Choi, 1997; Oh and Choi, 2002).

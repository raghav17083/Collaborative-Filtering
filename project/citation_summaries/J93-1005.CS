Attention has mostly been limited to selectional preferences of verbs, which have been used for example for syntactic disambiguation (Hindle and Rooth, 1993), word sense disambiguation (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003) and semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). 
The problem is analogous to the prepositional phrase attachment task explored in Hindle and Rooth (1993). 
PP attachments are resolved using Hindle and Rooth's (1993) lexical association score. 
This paper proposes an approximation, similar to the empirical approaches to PP attachment decision (Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos, 1994; Collins and Brooks, 1995). 
Among the applications of collocational analysis for lexical acquisition are: the derivation of syntactic disambiguation cues (Basili et al. 1991, 1993a; Hindle and Rooths 1991,1993; Sekine 1992) (Bogges et al. 1992), sense preference (Yarowski 1992), acquisition of selectional restrictions (Basili et al. 1992b, 1993b; Utsuro et al. 1993), lexical preference in generation (Smadjia 1991), word clustering (Pereira 1993; Hindle 1990; Basili et al. 1993c), etc. In the majority of these papers, even though the (precedent or subsequent) statistical processing reduces the number of accidental associations, very large corpora (10,000,000 words) are necessary to obtain reliable data on a "large enough" number of words.

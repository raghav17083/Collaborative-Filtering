Alternatively, systems that need to generate texts with rich layout might prefer to interleave document structuring with rhetorical structuring (e.g. , Cahill et al. 2001). 
In all but a few recent cases (the ICONOCLAST system (Power 2000; Bouayad-Agha, Power, and Scott 2000; Bouayad-Agha, Scott, and Power 2001; Bouayad-Agha 2001) and the DArt bio system (Bateman et al. 2001)), this is achieved by mapping directly from the underlying discourse structure (Arens and  Information Technology Research Institute, University of Brighton, Lewes Road, Brighton BN2 4GJ, UK. 
(Bateman et al. 2001, page 430) However, Bateman and his colleagues do not provide a detailed account of the formation rules for layout structure, or of the constraints on the mapping between the RST tree and the layout structure. 
A number of other researchers have identified cases in which orthodox RST analysis of a text is problematic (e.g. , Moore and Pollack 1992; Moser and Moore 1996; Knott et al. 2001). 
First, a distinction is made between layout structure and physical layout (Bateman et al. 2001, section 3.1); although the discussion concerns boxes in a grid rather than more conventional linguistic units like section and paragraph, this distinction reflects the need for an abstract level of representation that can be related more easily to the rhetorical structure of the message.

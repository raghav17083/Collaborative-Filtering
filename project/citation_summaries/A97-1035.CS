Following the trichotomy of NLP data representation models in (Cunningham et al. , 1997), the XML markup contains additive information, while the multi-level chart contains positional and abstraction-based information, e.g., feature structures representing NLP entities in a uniform, linguistically motivated form. 
An example of a generic pipeline architecture is GATE (Cunningham et al. , 1997) which provides an infrastructure for building NLP applications. 
However, it has been criticized for being too committed to a particular approach to linguistic analysis and representation ( Cunningham et al. , 1997). 
An example of the efforts in such a direction is GATE (a General Architecture for Text Engineering, (Cunningham et al. , 1997)), which provides a software infrastructure on top of which heterogeneous NLP processing modules may be evaluated and refined individually, or may be combined into larger application systems. 
The result of the LAM is what (Cunningham et al. , 1997) would call a Data Resource (as opposed to a Processing Resource, which corresponds to a LM).

Cherry and Bergsma (2005) extended the work of Lappin and Leass (1994) for largescale anaphoricity determination by additionally detecting non-anaphoric instances of it using Minipars pleonastic category Subj. 
In fact, several popular weakly supervised learning algorithms such as self-training, co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998), and EM (Dempster et al., 1977) have been applied to coreference resolution (Ng and Cardie, 2003) and the related task of pronoun resolution (Muller et al., 2002; Kehler et al., 2004; Cherry and Bergsma, 2005). 
For the heuristic rule-based approaches, Paice and Husk (1987), Lappin and Leass (1994), Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), Denber (1998), and Cherry and Bergsma (2005) looked for particular constructions using certain trigger words to identify pleonastic pronouns while Vieira and Poesio (2000) recognized non-anaphoric definite NPs through the use of syntactic cues and casesensitive rules and found that nearly 50% of definite NPs are non-anaphoric. 
Secondly, while most pronoun resolution evaluations simply exclude non-referential pronouns, recent unsupervised approaches (Cherry and Bergsma, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2007) must deal with all pronouns in unrestricted text, and therefore need robust modules to automatically handle non-referential instances. 
We test on the ANC Test set (1291 instances) also used in Bergsma (2005) (highest resolution accuracy reported: 73.3%), the anaphoralabelled portion of AQUAINT used in Cherry and Bergsma (2005) (1078 instances, highest accuracy: 71.4%), and the anaphoric pronoun subset of the MUC7 (1997) coreference evaluation formal test set (169 instances, highest precision of 62.1 reported on all pronouns in (Ng and Cardie, 2002)).

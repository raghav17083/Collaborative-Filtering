Based on hand-crafted semantic grammar rules, rule-based approaches fill slots in semantic frames using word pattern and semantic tokens (Dowding et al., 1994; Ward and Issar, 1994). 
The CommandTalk Spoken Dialogue System* Amanda Stent, John Dowding Jean Mark Gawron, Elizabeth Owen Bratt, and Robert Moore SRI International 333 Ravenswood Avenue Menlo Park, CA 94025 {stent,dowding,gawron,owen,bmoore}@ai.sri.com 1 Introduction CommandTalk (Moore et al. , 1997) is a spokenlanguage interface to the ModSAF battlefield simulator that allows simulation operators to generate and execute military exercises by creating forces and control measures, assigning missions to forces, and controlling the display (Ceranowicz, 1994). 
Traditionally, most semantic parser systems have been built using hand-crafted semantic grammar rules and so-called robust parsing (Ward and Issar, 1996; Seneff, 1992; Dowding et al. , 1994) is used to handle the ill-formed user input in which word patterns corresponding to semantic tokens are used to fill slots in different semantic frames in parallel. 
A more controlled robustness is expected with a complete linguistic analysis (Young, 1994; Hanrieder and GSrz, 1995; Dowding et al. , 1994). 
This grammar is used to provide all the language modeling capabilities of the system, including the language model used in the speech recognizer, the syntactic and semantic interpretation of user utterances (Dowding et al. , 1994), and the generation of system responses (Shieber et al. , 1990).

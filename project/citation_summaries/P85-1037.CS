The recognized necessity to describe the concept lexicon prior to dealing with natural languages is a feature which clearly distinguishes our approach from Computational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1987 277 Sergei Nirenburg and Victor Raskin The Subworld Concept Lexicon and the Lexicon Management System other work on lexical aids (e.g. , Ahlswede 1985) and brings us closer to some non-NL work on knowledge acquisition (e.g. , Lenat et al. 1986). 
Among the attempts to enrich lexical information, many have been directed to the analysis of dictionary definitions and the transformation of the implicit information to explicit knowledge bases for computational purposes (Amsler, 1981; Calzolari, 1984; Chodorow et al., 1985; Markowitz et al., 1986; Klavans et al., 1990; Vossen and Copestake, 1993). 
[Chodorow et al. , 1985; Guthrie et al. , 1990], in which the syntactic head of a noun phrase does not reflect semantic thrust. 
Substantial application of semantic or pragmatic knowledge about the word and its context requires compiling huge amounts of knowledge, the usefulness of which for practical applications in broad domains has not yet been proven (e.g. , Lenat et al. 1990; Nirenburg et al. 1988; Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidron 1985). 
Many attempts have also been made to transform the implicit information in dictionary definitions to explicit knowledge bases for computational purposes (Amsler, 1981; Calzolaxi, 1984; Chodorow et al. , 1985; Maxkowitz et al. , 1986; Klavans et al. , 1990; Vossen and Copestake, 1993).

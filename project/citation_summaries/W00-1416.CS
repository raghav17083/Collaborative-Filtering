Most GRE algorithms are limited to individual target objects (for an exception, Stone 2000), but we will present ones that refer to sets of objects (Van Deemter 2000); reference to an individual a17 will equal reference to the singleton set a18a19a17a21a20. 
Recently, algorithms have been applied to the identification of sets of objects rather than individuals [Bateman 1999, Stone 2000, Krahmer, v. Erk, and Verweg 2001], and the repertoire of descriptions has been extended to boolean combinations of attributes, including negations [van Deemter 2002]. 
There are many other algorithms described in the literature: see, for example, (Horacek, 1997; Bateman, 1999; Stone, 2000; Gardent, 2002). 
2 Motivation Identifying sets of objects originally followed the incremental algorithm (Dale and Reiter 1995), as in (Bateman 1999), (Stone 2000) and (Krahmer et al. 2003), with limited coverage, since only few attributes typically apply to all intended referents and to none of the potential distractors. 
Recently, algorithms have also been developed to the identification of sets of objects rather than individuals (Bateman 1999, Stone 2000, Krahmer, v. Erk, and Verweg 2001), and the repertoire of descriptions has been extended to boolean combinations of attributes, including negations (van Deemter 2002).

Another option, followed by (Setzer, 2001) (and in a very simplified way, by (Katz and Arosio, 2001)) is to use a few rules of inference (similar to the example seen in the previous paragraph), and to compare the closures (with respect to these rules) of the human annotations. 
This is partly due to the absence of readily available corpora annotated with temporal information, although efforts are underway to develop treebanks marked with temporal relations (Katz and Arosio, 2001) and devise annotation schemes that are suitable for coding temporal relations (Ferro et al. , 2000; Setzer and Gaizauskas, 2001). 
The saturation of the graph of relations is not done with a few handcrafted rules of the form (relation between e1 and e2) + (relation between e2 and e3) gives (a simple relation between e1 and e3) (Setzer, 2001; Katz and Arosio, 2001) but with the use of the full algebra of Allen relation. 
This is the path chosen by (Katz and Arosio, 2001; Setzer, 2001) with human annotators. 
SputLink is based on James Allens interval algebra (1983) and was inspired by (Setzer, 2001) and (Katz and Arosio, 2001) who both added a closure component to an annotation environment.

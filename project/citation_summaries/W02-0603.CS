Substrings in the lexicon are proposed as morphs within a word based on frequency alone, independently of phrase-, wordand morph-surroundings (de Marcken, 1996; Peng and Schuurmans, 2001; Creutz and Lagus, 2002). 
We utilize an evaluation method for segmentation of words presented in (Creutz and Lagus, 2002). 
4.1 Segmentation algorithms The new probabilistic method is compared to two existing segmentation methods: the Recursive MDL method presented in (Creutz and Lagus, 2002)10 and John Goldsmiths algorithm called Linguistica (Goldsmith, 2001).11 Both methods use MDL (Minimum Description Length) (Rissanen, 1989) as a criterion for model optimization. 
Typically, generative models are used, either formulated in a Bayesian framework, e.g., (Brent, 1999; Creutz, 2003); or applying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, e.g., (de Marcken, 1996; Goldsmith, 2001; Creutz and Lagus, 2002). 
A Poisson distribution can be justified and has been used in order to model the length distribution of word and morph tokens [e.g. , (Creutz and Lagus, 2002)], but for morph types we have chosen the gamma distribution, which has a thicker tail.

The system under evaluation here is based on language processing components that have demonstrated strong performance capabilities in previous evaluation s [Lehnert et al . 1992a] . Having demonstrated the general viability of these techniques, we are no w concentrating on the practicality of our technology by creating trainable system components to replac e hand-coded data and manually-engineered software. 
(Yangarber and Grishman, 1997), while others have focused on methods for automatically converting a corpus annotated with extraction examples into such patterns (Lehnert et al. , 1992; Fisher et al. , 1995; Miller et al. , 1998).

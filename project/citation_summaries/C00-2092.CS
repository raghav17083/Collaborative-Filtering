3 Data-Oriented Translation Data-Oriented Translation (DOT) (Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003), which is based on DataOriented Parsing (DOP) (Bod, 1998; Bod et al. , 2003), comprises a context-rich, experience-based approach to translation, where new translations are derived with reference to grammatical analyses of previous translations. 
Recently, many syntax-based models have been proposed to address the above deficiencies (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2005; Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007; Bod, 2007; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007; Gildea, 2003; Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003). 
7 Related work Similarly to (Poutsma, 2000; Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005), the rules discussed in this paper are equivalent to productions of synchronous tree substitution grammars. 
In Bod (2007), we compared U-DOP* and DOP* in a syntax-based MT system known as Data-Oriented Translation or DOT (Poutsma 2000; Groves et al. 2004). 
1 Introduction The Data-Oriented Translation (DOT) (Poutsma, 2000) model is a tree-structured translation model, in which linked subtree fragments extracted from a parsed bitext are composed to cover a sourcelanguage sentence to be translated.

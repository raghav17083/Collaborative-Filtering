Although many existing machine learning approaches to coreference resolution have performed reasonably well without explicit anaphoricity determination (e.g., Soon et al 2001; Ng and Cardie 2002b; Strube and Muller 2003; Yang et al 2003, 2008), anaphoricity determination has been studied fairly extensively in the literature, given the potential usefulness of NP anaphoricity in coreference resolution. 
The AR community has recently made two important findings:  A model that identifies the antecedent of an anaphor by a series of comparisons between candidate antecedents has a remarkable advantage over a model that estimates the absolute likelihood of each candidate independently of other candidates (Iida et al. , 2003; Yang et al. , 2003).

Early work of anaphora resolution focuses on finding antecedents of pronouns (Hobbs, 1976; Ge et al. , 1998; Mitkov, 1998), while recent advances (Soon et al. , 2001; Yang et al. , 2003; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Ittycheriah et al. , 2003) employ statistical machine learning methods and try to resolve reference among all kinds of noun phrases (NP), be it a name, nominal, or pronominal phrase  which is the scope of this paper as well. 
The model in (Yang et al. , 2003) expands the conditioning scope by including a competing candidate.

The system was originally conceived as a preprocessor for TACITUS that could be run in a stand-alone mode . Considerably later in our development we decided that the performance of FASTUS on the MUC-4 task was so high that we could make FASTUS our complete system . Most of the design work for the FASTUS system took place during January . The ideas were tested ou t on finding incident locations in February, and with some initial favorable results in hand, we proceded wit h the implementation of the system in March . The implementation of the second phase of processing wa s completed in March, and the general outline of phase three was completed by the end of April . On May 6, we did the first test of the FASTUS system on TST2, which had been withheld as a fair test, and we obtained a score of 8% recall and 42% precision . At that point we began a fairly intensive effort to hill-clim b on all 1300 development texts, doing periodic runs on the fair test to monitor our progress, culminating i n a score of 44% recall, 57% precision in the wee hours of June 1, when we decided to run the official test . As the chart in Figure 1 points out, the rate of progress was rapid enough that even a few hours of work coul d be shown to have a noticeable impact on the score . Our scarcest resource was time, and our supply of it wa s eventually exhausted well before the point of diminishing returns . CONCLUSIONS FASTUS was more successful than we ever dreamed when the idea was originally conceived .

The system's phase-3 works successfully because the input from phase-2 is already reliably processed . Phase two does only the linguistic processing that can be done reliably and fast, ignoring all the problems of makin g attachment decisions, and the ambiguity introduced by coordination and appositives . This input is adequate for phase-3 because the domain pragmatics are sufficiently constrained that given this initial chunking, th e relevant information can be reliably detected and extracted . One source of frustration with the development of this system is that we never had the opportunity t o produce a decent developer's interface . We believe that phase-2 is almost completely domain independent, with all the domain specific knowledge embedded in the phase-3 automata . We feel that with some carefu l thought devoted to such an interface, we could produce a general text processing system that could b e brought up to our current level of performance on a MUC-like or TIPSTER-like task in even less than th e three and a half weeks of effort that we required . Another discovery of this experience is that a MUG-like task is much easier than anyone ever thought . Although the full linguistic complexity of the MUC texts is very high, with long sentences and interestin g discourse structure problems, the relative simplicity of the information-extraction task allows much of thi s linguistic complexity to by bypassed  indeed much more than we had originally believed was possible . The key to the whole problem, as we see it from our FASTUS experience, is to do exactly the right amount of syntax, so that pragmatics can take over its share of the load . For the MUC task, we think FASTUS display s exactly the right mixture . Finally, we point out that while FASTUS is an elegant engineering achievement,, the whole host o f linguistic problems that were bypassed are still out there, and will have to be addressed eventually fo r more complex tasks . and to achieve ever higher performance on simpler tasks . The nature of competitive evaluations is that they force everyone to deal with the easiest problems first . However, the hard problems cannot be ignored forever, and scientific progress requires that they be addressed . 146 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under Office of Nava l Research contracts N00014-90-C-0220, and by an internal research and development grant from SRI Inter national .

In approaching the problem of unrestricted texts, we agree with those researchers (Hobbs, 1991; Grishman et al. , 1991) who think that it is possible to build correct parses and interpretations for realworld texts.

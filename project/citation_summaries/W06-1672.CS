 Models constructed from bilingual dictionaries of terms and names, e.g., (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Huang et al., 2004; Haizhou et al., 2004; Zelenko and Aone, 2006; Yoon et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007; Karimi et al., 2007; Sherif and Kondrak, 2007b; Goldwasser and Roth, 2008b). 
Zelenko and Aone (2006) investigate a purely discriminative, alignment-free approach to transliteration generation. 
61 Zelenko and Aone (2006) model transliteration as a structured prediction problem where the letter ei is predicted using local and global features derived from e1e2 ei1 and f. Bergsma and Kondrak (2007) address cognate identification by training a SVM classification model using phrase-based features obtained from a Levenshtein alignment. 
In addition, some recent studies investigate discriminative transliteration methods (Klementiev and Roth, 2006; Zelenko and Aone, 2006) in which each segment of the source can be aligned to each segment of the target, where some restrictive conditions based on the distance of the segments and phonetic similarities are applied. 
Source-target pairs are either extracted from bilingual documents or dictionaries (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003; Bilac and Tanaka, 2005; Oh and Choi, 2006; Zelenko and Aone, 2006), or gathered explicitly from human transliterators (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Zelenko and Aone, 2006).

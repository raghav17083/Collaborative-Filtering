Zhao and Grishman (2005) defined several featurebased composite kernels to integrate diverse features for relation extraction and achieved the F-measure of 70.4 on the 7 relation types of the ACE RDC 2004 corpus . Zhang et al (2006) proposed two composite kernels to integrate a linear kernel and Collins and Duffys convolution tree kernel. 
Recently, kernel 49 methods are also becoming widely used for relation extraction (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Zhao and Grishman, 2005). 
Also using kernel methods and support vector machines, (Zhao and Grishman, 2005) combine clues from different levels of syntactic information and applies composite kernels to integrate the individual kernels.

For this reason, kernels have been recently used to develop innovative approaches to relation extraction based on syntactic information, in which the examples preserve their original representations (i.e. parse trees) and are compared by the kernel function (Zelenko et al. , 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Zhao and Grishman, 2005).

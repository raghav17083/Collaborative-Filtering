2 Our Proposed Approach 2.1 Chinese Word Segmentation as Tagging One of the difficulties in Chinese word segmentation is that, Chinese characters can appear in different positions within a word (Xue and Shen, 2003), and LMR Tagging was proposed to solve the problem. 
Segmentation performance has been improved significantly, from the earliest maximal match (dictionary-based) approaches to HMM-based (Zhang et al., 2003) approaches and recent state-of-the-art machine learning approaches such as maximum entropy (MaxEnt) (Xue and Shen, 2003), support vector machine (SVM) (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001), conditional random fields (CRF) (Peng and McCallum, 2004), and minimum error rate training (Gao et al., 2004). 
Feature Type Example  Features extracted of character _d_932 1 Characters within window of2 C2=3, C1=2, C0=_d_932, C1=_d_9838, C2=_d_4766 2 Two consecutive characters within window of2 C2C1=32, C1C0=2_d_932, C0C1=_d_932_d_9838, C1C2=_d_9838_d_4766 3 Previous and next characters C1C1= 2_d_9838 4 Current character is punctuation  5 ASCII characters within window of2 A2,A1 (as 3 and 2 are ASCII) 6 Current and character in window1 belong to different types D1 (as 2 is digit, but  _d_932 is letter) Additional feature templates as compared to (Xue and Shen, 2003) and (Ng and Low, 2004) are template 5 and 6. 
For the Chinese word segmenter, it is based on the work that treats Chinese word segmentation as tagging (Xue and Shen, 2003; Ng and Low, 2004). 
Segmentation performance has been improved significantly, from the earliest maximal match (dictionary-based) approaches to HMM-based (Zhang et al. , 2003) approaches and recent state-of-the-art machine learning approaches such as maximum entropy (MaxEnt) (Xue and Shen, 2003), support vector machine Now the second author is affiliated with NTT.

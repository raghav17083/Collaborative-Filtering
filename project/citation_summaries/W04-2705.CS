W09-2603:1	38:204	2.1 Current Deverbal Mapping System We have a list of approximately 4000 deverbal noun / verb pairs, constructed from a combination of WordNets derivational links (Fellbaum, 1998), NomLex (Macleod et al., 1998), NomLexPlus (Meyers et al., 2004b) and some independent curation.
---------------------------------------------------
W09-2603:2	186:204	In recent years, NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004a) has provided a set of about 200,000 manually annotated instances of nominalizations with arguments, giving rise to supervised machinelearned approaches such as (Pradhan et al., 2004) and (Liu and Ng, 2007), which perform fairly well in the overall task of classifying deverbal arguments.
---------------------------------------------------
N06-1055:3	23:170	2 The Chinese Nombank The Chinese Nombank extends the general annotation framework of the English Proposition Bank (Palmer et al. , 2005) and the English Nombank (Meyers et al. , 2004) to the annotation of nominalized predicates in Chinese.
---------------------------------------------------
J08-2001:4	15:86	Research has proceeded for decades on manually created lexicons, grammars, and other semantic resources (Hirst 1987; Pustejovsky 1995; Copestake and Flickinger 2000) in support of deep semantic analysis of language input, but such approaches have been labor-intensive and often restricted to narrow domains.The 1990s saw a growth in the development of statistical machine learning methods across the eld of computational linguistics, enabling systems to learn complex linguistic knowledge rather than requiring manual encoding.These methods were shown to be effective in acquiring knowledge necessary for semantic interpretation, such as the properties of predicates and the relations to their argumentsfor example, learning subcategorization frames (Briscoe and Carroll 1997) or classifying verbs according to argument structure properties (Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Schulte im Walde 2006).Recently, medium-to-large corpora have been manually annotated with semantic roles in FrameNet (Fillmore, Ruppenhofer, and Baker 2004), PropBank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005), and NomBank (Meyers et al.2004), enabling the development of statistical approaches specically for SRL.
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1059:5	9:170	This is a purely syntactic resource, but we can also include this treebank in the category of multistratal resources since the PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004) projects have annotated shallow semantic structures on top of it.
---------------------------------------------------
W06-1617:6	21:156	NomBank frames combine various lexical resources (Meyers et al. , 2004a), including an extended NOMLEX and PropBank frames, and form the basis for annotating the argument structures of common nouns.
---------------------------------------------------
W06-1617:7	19:156	2 Overview of NomBank The NomBank (Meyers et al. , 2004c; Meyers et al. , 2004b) annotation project originated from the NOMLEX (Macleod et al. , 1997; Macleod et al. , 1998) nominalization lexicon developed under the New York University Proteus Project.
---------------------------------------------------
W06-1617:8	11:156	The recent release of NomBank (Meyers et al. , 2004c; Meyers et al. , 2004b), a databank that annotates argument structure for instances of common nouns in the Penn Treebank II corpus, made it possible to develop automatic SRL systems that analyze the argument structures of noun predicates.
---------------------------------------------------
W06-1617:9	137:156	Preliminary consistency tests reported in (Meyers et al. , 2004c) shows that NomBanks interannotator agreement rate is about 85% for core arguments and lower for adjunct arguments.
---------------------------------------------------
W06-1617:10	82:156	Most of these nominal predicates are DEFREL relational nouns (Meyers et al. , 2004c).
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1004:11	17:221	As a complement to PropBank, NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004) annotates nominal predicates and their corresponding semantic roles using similar semantic framework as PropBank.
---------------------------------------------------
W08-2127:12	19:131	Both parsing is formulated as a single-stage word-pair classification problem, and the latter is carried out by a search through the NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004) or the PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005)1.
---------------------------------------------------
N06-2015:13	65:75	7 Related and Future Work PropBank I (Palmer et al. , 2005), developed at UPenn, captures predicate argument structure for verbs; NomBank provides predicate argument structure for nominalizations and other noun predicates (Meyers et al. , 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1055:14	7:129	In English predicate argument structure analysis, large corpora such as FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2001), PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004) have been created and utilized.
---------------------------------------------------
W09-2423:15	76:180	These features are marked in the NOMLEX-PLUS dictionary (Meyers et al., 2004b).
---------------------------------------------------
W09-2423:16	15:180	One of the most popular, semantic role labels (annotation and transducers based on the annotation) characterize relations anchored by select predicate types like verbs (Palmer et al., 2005), nouns (Meyers et al., 2004a), discourse connectives (Miltsakaki et al., 2004) or those predicates that are part of particular semantic frames (Baker et al., 1998).
---------------------------------------------------
W07-1517:17	14:81	The annotation schemes currently embedded in MAIS are the Proposition Bank (Palmer et al. , 2005), NomBank (Meyers et al. , 2004) and TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al. , 2003).
---------------------------------------------------
W09-1210:18	109:135	(Palmer et al., 2005; Meyers et al., 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
W08-2130:19	31:122	2.2.1 Predicate Tagging According to PropBank (Palmer, et al., 2005) and NomBank (Meyers, et al., 2004), predicates usually have several rolesets corresponding to different meanings.
---------------------------------------------------
W09-1321:20	30:174	The PASbio(Wattarujeekrit et al., 2004) proposes Predicate Argument Structures (PASs), a type of linguistically-oriented semantic structures, for domain-specic lexical items, based on PASs dened in PropBank(Wattarujeekrit et al., 2004) and NomBank(Meyers et al., 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
W04-2701:21	17:24	The rst six papers describe linguistic annotation in four languages: Spanish (Alcantara and Moreno, 2004), English (Miltsakaki et al. , 2004; Babko-Malaya et al. , 2004; Meyers et al. , 2004), Czech (Sgall et al. , 2004) and German(Baumann et al. , 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
W04-2701:22	13:24	For example, if one accepts the framework of the Penn Treebank, it is easy to move on to representations of deeper structure as suggested in three papers in this volume (Miltsakaki et al. , 2004; Babko-Malaya et al. , 2004; Meyers et al. , 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
W09-1201:23	256:361	 NomBank  NomBank annotation (Meyers et al., 2004) uses essentially the same framework as PropBank to annotate arguments of nouns.

The rst 4 papers (Pustejovsky et al. , 2005; E. W. Hinrichs and S. Kcurrency1ubler and K. Naumann, 2005; Bies et al. , 2005; Dinesh et al. , 2005) all discuss some aspect of merging annotation. 
Pie in the Sky can be viewed as a framework for unifying these annotation schemata into a single representation (a Uni ed Linguistic Annotation framework in the sense of (Pustejovsky et al. , 2005)). 
Although state of the art methods for modular discourse-new detection (Uryupina, 2003; Poesio et al. , 2005) do not achieve near-perfect accuracy for discourse-new detection, the results we give for antecedent selection represent an upper bound on recall and precision for the full coreference task, and we think that this upper bound will be useful for Lascarides, 1998) is a much broader concept, the term coreferent bridging is potentially confusing, as many cases are examples of perfectly well-behaved anaphoric definite noun phrases. 
Other work presented assumes that the integrated framework is the object of the annotation rather than the result of merging annotations (E. W. Hinrichs and S. Kcurrency1ubler and K. Naumann, 2005; McShane et al. , 2005). 
In fact, with help from the authors of (Calhoun et al. , 2005), I did incorporate their analysis into the latest version (number 6) of the Pie in the Sky annotation.

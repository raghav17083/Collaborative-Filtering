There has been considerable skepticism over whether WSD will actually improve performance of applications, but we are now starting to see improvement in performance due to WSD in cross-lingual information retrieval (Clough and Stevenson, 2004; Vossen et al., 2006) and machine translation (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007) and we hope that other applications such as question-answering, text simplication and summarisation might also benet as WSD methods improve. 
Furthermore, they extended WSD to phrase sense disambiguation (PSD) (Carpuat and Wu, 2007a). 
Carpuat and Wu (2007) and Chan et al. 
On the other hand, integrating an additional component into a baseline SMT system is notoriously tricky as evident in the research on integrating word sense disambiguation (WSD) into SMT systems: different ways of integration lead to conflicting conclusions on whether WSD helps MT performance (Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007). 
We are starting to see the beginnings of a positive effect of WSD in NLP applications such as Machine Translation (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007).

MSRSeg (Gao et al. , 2003; Gao et al.), Microsoft Research Asias Chinese word segmentation system that is integrated with named entity recognition, is used to segment Chinese words. 
For unknown word w r, the emission probability is x/(M-m i ), where M is the number of all the words appearing in training data, 502 and m i is the number of distinct words occurring in state i. Then, we use a back-off schema (Katz, 1987) to deal with the data sparseness problem when estimating the probability P(L) (Gao et al. , 2003). 
Conventionally, there are four approaches to develop a CWS: (1) Dictionary-based approach (Cheng et al. 1999), especial forward and backward maximum matching (Wong and Chan, 1996); (2) Linguistic approach based on syntaxsemantic knowledge (Chen et al. 2002); (3) Statistical approach based on statistical language model (SLM) (Sproat and Shih, 1990; Teahan et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2003); and (4) Hybrid approach trying to combine the benefits of dictionary-based, linguistic and statistical approaches (Tsai et al. 2003; Ma and Chen, 2003). 
Our approach is tested on a state-ofthe-art Chinese word segmentation system (Gao et al. , 2003, 2004). 
That is if we collect all words seen in the training data and store them into a lexicon, then each word in a test set is either a lexicon word or an OOV (out of vocabulary) word (Gao et al. , 2003).

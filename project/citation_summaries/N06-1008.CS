Torisawa (2006) addresses a similar problem, but focuses on temporal relations, and makes use of the phenomena of Japanese coordinate sentences. 
Motivated by this issue, several research groups have reported their experiments on automatic acquisition of causal, temporal and entailment relations between event expressions (typically verbs or verb phrases) (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Inui et al., 2003; Chklovski and Pantel, 2005; Torisawa, 2006; Pekar, 2006; Zanzotto et al., 2006; Abe et al., 2008, etc.). 
Torisawa (2006), on the other hand, acquires entailment relations by combining the verb pairs extracted with a highly generic connective pattern Verb-X and Verb-Y together with the cooccurrence statistics between verbs and their arguments. 
Typical target relations include Reaction and Production (Pantel and Pennacchiootti, 2006), person-affiliation and organization-location (Zelenko et al., 2002), part-whole (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Girju et al., 2006) and temporal precedence relations between events (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004; Torisawa, 2006). 
Motivated by this background, several research groups have reported their experiments on automatic acquisition of causal, temporal and entailment relations between event mentions (typically verbs or verb phrases) (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Inui et al., 2003; Chklovski and Pantel, 2005; Torisawa, 2006; Pekar, 2006; Zanzotto et al., 2006, etc.).

The range of research includes the interpretation of combined linguistic and diagrammatic input (e.g. Klein and Pineda, 1990), the generation of multimedia explanations (e.g. Wahlster et al. , 1991), the integration of NLP with hypertext (Stock, 1991), and the combination of natural language input with pointing (e.g. Kobsa et al. , 1986), menus (Tennant ctal. 
5.3 Pointing actions in TAGTILUS One aim of XTRA is the integration of (typed) verbal descriptions and pointing gestures (currently realized by mouse-clicks) for referent identification (Kobsa et al. 1986). 
In the specific case of combining natural language and graphics, there have been two main areas of study: interacting with graphical elements to resolve ambiguous references on the natural language side (Bolt, 1980; Kobsa et al. , 1986); and generating coordinated text and graphic presentations using information from a knowledgebase (Andr and Rist (1994); Towns et al. 
In common with many other systems (e.g. Kobsa et al. , 1986), we also allow the user to refer to aJt object by pointing to it. 
Furthermore, systems that mix for example deictic and natural-language input require that linguistic status be given to sentence fragments, thus demanding incremental analysis (Kobsa et al. 1986).

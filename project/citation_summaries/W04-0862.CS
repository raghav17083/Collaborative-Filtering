The feature engineering (and construction of three other component models which are described in (Wicentowski et al. , 2004)) was performed at Swarthmore College, while the Hong Kong team constructed two component models based on wellknown machine learning algorithms. 
Since the task is quite similar to more traditional lexical sample tasks, we extend an approach used successfully in multiple Senseval-3 lexical sample tasks (Wicentowski et al. , 2004). 
Recall Attempted Single Model 0.764 0.682 89.2% Baseline 0.444 0.396 89.2% Table 4: SNOW Models: Validation Set Results 3.5 Decision Lists The final individual system was a decision list implementation contributed from the Swarthmore College team (Wicentowski et al. , 2004), which participated in some of the lexical sample tasks. 
The first entry, a supervised system used in the Multilingual Chinese-English Lexical Sample task (Task 5), is an extension of the system described in (Wicentowski et al. , 2004). 
2 Experimental Features A full description of the experimental features for all four tasks can be found in the report submitted by the Swarthmore College Senseval team (Wicentowski et al. , 2004).

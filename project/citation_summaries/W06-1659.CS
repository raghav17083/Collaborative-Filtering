The approach uses an unsupervised graph-based mutual reinforcement, which depends on the construction of generalized extraction patterns that could match instances of relationships (Hassan et al. , 2006). 
Studying relationships between tagged named entities, (Hasegawa et al, 2004; Hassan et al, 2006) proposed unsupervised clustering methods that assign given (or semi-automatically extracted) sets of pairs into several clusters, where each cluster corresponds to one of a known relationship type. 
3 BioNoculars BioNoculars is a relationship extraction system that based on a fully unsupervised technique suggested by (Hassan et al. , 2006) to automatically extract protein-protein interaction from medical articles. 
Studying relationships between tagged named entities, (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Hassan et al., 2006) proposed unsupervised clustering methods that assign given sets of pairs into several clusters, where each cluster corresponds to one of a known set of relationship types. 
Several studies utilize some preprocessing, including parsing (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Hassan et al., 2006) and usage of syntactic (Suchanek et al., 2006) and morphological (Pantel et al., 2004) information in patterns.

DAM is completely described in Byrd, et al.(1986b). 
The recognized necessity to describe the concept lexicon prior to dealing with natural languages is a feature which clearly distinguishes our approach from Computational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1987 277 Sergei Nirenburg and Victor Raskin The Subworld Concept Lexicon and the Lexicon Management System other work on lexical aids (e.g. , Ahlswede 1985) and brings us closer to some non-NL work on knowledge acquisition (e.g. , Lenat et al. 1986). 
This system (called UDICT, the ultimate dictionary) is described in Byrd 1983 and Byrd et al. 1986. 
The work in lexicon has centered on a) studies concerned with the utilization of conventional humanoriented dictionaries, newly available in machine-readable form, for computational tasks (e.g. , Amsler 1984a,b; Chodorow et al. 1985; Ahlswede 1985; Markowitz et al. 1986) improving the ancillary capabilities for lexicon systems, such as, for instance, morphological processors and descriptions (e.g. , Nirenburg and Ben Asher 1984; Byrd et al. 1986; Boguraev et al. 1987); c) hand-building of lexicons necessary for natural language systems, often with considerations about extensibility (e.g. , Zernik and Dyer 1985; Bessemer and Jacobs 1987). 
Individual tools and their use in that project have been described elsewhere (Chodorow, et a1.(1985), Byrd and Chodorow(1985), Byrd, et al.(1986b), Chodorow and Ravin(1987), Neff and Byrd(1987)).

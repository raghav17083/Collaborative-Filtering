3 CLaC-NB System: Nave Bayes Supervised statistical methods have been very successful in sentiment tagging of texts and in subjectivity detection at sentence level: on movie review texts they reach an accuracy of 85-90% (Aue and Gamon, 2005; Pang and Lee, 2004) and up to 92% accuracy on classifying movie review snippets into subjective and objective using both Nave Bayes and SVM (Pang and Lee, 2004). 
These methods perform particularly well when a large volume of labeled data from the same domain as the 292 test set is available for training (Aue and Gamon, 2005). 
A number of methods has been proposed in order to overcome this system portability limitation by using out-of-domain data, unlabelled in-domain corpora or a combination of in-domain and out-of-domain examples (Aue and Gamon, 2005; Bai et al., 2005; Drezde et al., 2007; Tan et al., 2007). 
291 3.1 Level of Analysis Research on sentiment annotation is usually conducted at the text (Aue and Gamon, 2005; Pang et al., 2002; Pang and Lee, 2004; Riloff et al., 2006; Turney, 2002; Turney and Littman, 2003) or at the sentence levels (Gamon and Aue, 2005; Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2005; Riloff et al., 2006). 
These methods perform particularly well when a large volume of labeled data from the same domain as the test set is available for training (Aue and Gamon, 2005).

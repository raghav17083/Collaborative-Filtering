Alternate formulations of sentiment summarization are possible, including aspect-based summarization (Hu and Liu, 2004a), abstractive summarization (Carenini et al., 2006) or related tasks such as opinion attribution (Choi et al., 2005). 
The questionnaire consists of questions asking for Likert ratings and is adapted from the questionnaire in (Carenini et al., 2006). 
Sentiment summarization has been well studied in the past decade (Turney, 2002; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004a, 2004b; Carenini et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007). 
When systems are evaluated end-to-end by human judges, the studies are often small, consisting of only a handful of judges and data points (Carenini et al., 2006). 
For example, aspects of a digital camera could include picture quality, battery life, size, color, value, etc. Finding such aspects is a challenging research problem that has been addressed in a number of ways (Hu and Liu, 2004b; Gamon et al., 2005; Carenini et al., 2005; Zhuang et al., 2006; Branavan et al., 2008; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008; Titov and McDonald, 2008b; Titov and McDonald, 2008a).

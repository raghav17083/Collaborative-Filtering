[C. Niu et al. 2003] presented a bootstrapping approach for English named entity recognition using successive learners of parsing-based decision 40 System Statistical Model Linguistic Feature Combinative Points [Zhang et al. 2003] HMM semantic role, tokens pattern rules [Sun et al. 2002] class-based LM word form, NE category cue words list [Tsai et al. 2004] ME model tokens knowledge representation Table 1: Comparison between several Chinese NER systems1 list and HMM, and promising experiment results (F-measure: 69.8%) on product NE (corresponding to our PRO) were obtained. 
Some class-based segmentation models (Sun et al. , 2002; Gao et al. , 2003) well integrate the identification of some regular non-lexicalized units (such as named entities). 
Integrated Model[Sun, et al. 2002] [Zhang, et al. 2003][Yu, et al. 1998][Chua, et al. 2002] deals with all kinds of entities in a unified statistical framework. 
A wide variety of machine learning methods have been applied to this problem, including Hidden Markov Models (Bikel et al. 1997), Maximum Entropy methods (Borthwick et al. 1998, Chieu and Ng 2002), Decision Trees (Sekine et al. 1998), Conditional Random Fields (McCallum and Li 2003), Class-based Language Model (Sun et al. 2002), Agent-based Approach (Ye et al. 2002) and Support Vector Machines.

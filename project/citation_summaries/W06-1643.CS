ROUGE has been used in meeting summarization evaluation (Murray et al., 2005; Galley, 2006), yet the question remained whether ROUGE is a good metric for the meeting domain. 
The skip-chain CRFs (Sutton and McCallum, 2004; Galley, 2006) model the long distance dependency between context and answer sentences and the 2D CRFs (Zhu et al., 2005) model the dependency between contiguous questions. 
A variety of approaches have been investigated for speech summarization, for example, maximum entropy, conditional random fields, latent semantic analysis, support vector machines, maximum marginal relevance (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2003; Hori et al., 2003; Buist et al., 2005; Galley, 2006; Murray et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2007; Xie and Liu, 2008). 
For this study, we used the same 6 test meetings as in (Murray et al., 2005; Galley, 2006). 
Galley (2006) used skip-chain Conditional Random Fields to model pragmatic dependencies between paired meeting utterances (e.g. QUESTION-ANSWER relations), and used a combination of lexical, prosodic, structural and discourse features to rank utterances by importance.

According to this, SMT has also been approached from a finite-state point of view as the most natural way of integrating ASR and SMT (Riccardi, Pieraccini, and Bocchieri 1996; Vidal 1997; Knight and Al-Onaizan 1998; Bangalore and Riccardi 2000). 
Finite state models have been extensively applied to many aspects of language processing including, speech recognition (Pereira and Riley, 1997), phonology (Kaplan and Kay, 1994), morphology (Koskenniemi, 1984), chunking (Abney, 1991; Bangalore and Joshi, 1999), parsing (Roche, 1999; O azer, 1999) and machine translation (Vilar et al. , 1999; Bangalore and Riccardi, 2000). 
The SFST approach described here is similar to the one described in (Bangalore and Riccardi, 2000) which has subsequently been adopted by (Banchs et al. , 2005). 
In this way, as opposed to other implementations, where one-to-one (Bangalore and Riccardi 2000) or one-to-many (Casacuberta and Vidal 2004) alignments are used, tuples are extracted from many-to-many alignments. 
Finite-state machines have been extensively applied to many aspects of language processing including, speech recognition (Pereira and Riley, 1997; Riccardi et al. , 1996), phonology (Kaplan and Kay, 1994), morphology (Koskenniemi, 1984), chunking (Abney, 1991; Joshi and Hopely, 1997; Bangalore, 1997), parsing (Roche, 1999), and machine translation (Bangalore and Riccardi, 2000).

Allen and Perrault (Perrault et al. 1980) used mutual beliefs in their work on indirect speech acts and suggested their use in clarification and correction dialogs. 
Allen (Allen et al. 1980, Perrault et al. 1980) inferred the goal underlying a speaker's utterance in the context of an information agent in a train setting. 
This approach has led to formal and computational models of discourse processing (Allen 1979; Allen and Perrault 1980; Brachman et al. 1979; Cohen and Levesque, in preparation; Sidner et al. 1981). 
Allen and Perrault (1980) suggest that properties needed to "fill in" such fragments come from shared expectations (not just from prior syntactic forms, as is current practice in computational linguistics) . The property in question in our domain is IDENTIFIED-REFERENT(HEARER, NP), which is (somehow) derived from the nature of the task as one of manual assembly. 
The applicability conditions of the Obtain-Info-Ref act, such as the condition that _agent1 believe that _agent2 knows the information, are based on criteria identified in Searle (1970), Cohen and Perrault (1979), and Allen and Perrault (1980).

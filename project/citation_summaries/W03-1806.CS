Many efficient techniques exist to extract multiword expressions, collocations, lexical units and idioms (Church and Hanks, 1989; Smadja, 1993; Dias et al. , 2000; Dias, 2003).

A 5word window is the norm, while longer windows prove impractical (Dias, 2003). 
In general, the methodologies for the extraction of multiword expressions (MWEs, including MWVs) can be classified into syntactic, statistical and hybrid syntactic-statistical (Dias, 2003).

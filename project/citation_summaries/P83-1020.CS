This model is interesting in that it does not allow the parser to employ delay tactics, such as using a lookahead buffer (Marcus (1980), Marcus et al (1983)), or waiting for the head of a phrase to appear in the input before constructing that phrase (Abney (1987, 1989), Pritehett (1992)). 
The design of SUG incorporates ideas from Tree Adjoining Grammar, Description Theory (Marcus et al. , 1983), Combinatory Categorial Grammar, Lexical Functional Grammar, and Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar. 
2 Tree Descriptions In this section, we define the Constraint Language tbr DPL structures, CL(DPL), a language of tree descriptions which conserw~tively extends donfinance constraints (Marcus et al. , 1983; Rainbow et al. , 1995; Keller et al. , 2000) by variable binding constraints. 
ZNote that in Marcus et al (1983), since precedence relations were not computed for non-terminals, lowering into a predecessor was possible, thus (11) would cause no processing difficulty. 
They have been applied to incremental parsing (Marcus et al. , 1983), grammar formalisms (VijayShanker, 1992; Rambow et al. , 1995; Duchier and Thater, 1999; Perrier, 2000), discourse (Gardent and Webber, 1998), and scope underspeci cation (Muskens, 1995; Egg et al. , 1998).

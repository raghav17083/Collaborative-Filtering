Applications where word order is not essential include  cross-language information retrieval (e.g. , McCarley 1999),  multilingual document filtering (e.g. , Oard 1997),  computer-assisted language learning (e.g. , Nerbonne et al. 1997),  certain machine-assisted translation tools (e.g. , Macklovitch 1994; Melamed 1996a),  concordancing for bilingual lexicography (e.g. , Catizone, Russell, and Warwick 1989; Gale and Church 1991), 222 Melamed Models of Translational Equivalence  corpus linguistics (e.g. , Svartvik 1992),  "crummy" machine translation (e.g. , Church and Hovy 1992; Resnik 1997). 
First, it would be useful to combine our method for filtering out non-parallel texts with methods for detecting omissions in translations (Melamed, 1996). 
Such discontinuities can be automatically detected with high reliability (Melamed 1996). 
As the search rectangle grows, it will eventually intersect with the TBM, even if the discontinuity is quite large (Melamed, 1996b). 
Melamed (1996a) showed that sentence boundary information can be used to convert SIMR's output into sentence alignments that are more accurate than those obtained by either of the other two approaches.

The typical practice of preprocessing distributional data is to remove rare word co-occurrences, thus aiming to reduce noise from idiosyncratic word uses and linguistic processing errors and at the same time form more compact word representations (e.g. , Grefenstette, 1993; Ciaramita, 2002). 
Let us now compare our results to those obtained using shallow parsing, as previously done by Grefenstette (1993). 
It can also be considered as an extension from the monolingual to the bilingual case of the well-established methods for semantic or syntactic word clustering as proposed by Schtitze (1993), Grefenstette (1994), Ruge (1995), Rapp (1996), Lin (1998), and others. 
Grefenstette (1993) studied two context delineation methods of English nouns: the window-based and the syntactic, whereby all the different types of syntactic dependencies of the nouns were used in the same feature space. 
Its previous applications (e.g. , Grefenstette 1993, Hearst and Schuetze 1993, Takunaga et al 1997, Lin 1998, Caraballo 1999) demonstrated that cooccurrence statistics on a target word is often sufficient for its automatical classification into one of numerous classes such as synsets of WordNet.

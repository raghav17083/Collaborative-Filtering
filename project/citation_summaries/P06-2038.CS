Recent results making use of finite-state chunkers early in a syntactic parsing pipeline have shownbothanefficiency(GlaysherandMoldovan, 2006) and an accuracy (Hollingshead and Roark, 2007) benefit to the use of such constraints in a parsing system. 
This second constraint on possible trees can be thought of as a constraint on chart cells, as pointed out in Glaysher and Moldovan (2006): no multi-word spanning constituent can begin at a word falling within a base-phrase chunk, other than the first wordofthatchunk. 
a0 Compound concept detection: using a classifier based on WordNet a0 Syntactic Parsing: using an in-house implementation of Collin?s parser (Glaysher and Moldovan, 2006) The Maximum Entropy classifier is a C++ implementation found on web (Le, 2006). 
Glaysher and Moldovan (2006) demonstrated an efficiency gain by explicitly disallowing entries in chart cells that would result in constituents that cross chunk boundaries. 
Other recent examples of the utility of finite-state constraints for parsing pipelines include Glaysher and Moldovan (2006), Djordjevic et al.

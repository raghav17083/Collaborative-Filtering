Although related, this problem is distinct from tense and aspect interpretation in discourse (as addressed in, e.g., Webber 1988, Song & Cohen 1991, Hwang & Schubert 1992, Lascarides et al. 1992, and Kameyama et al. 1993). 
(b) Other preferences, such as a preference for relating the new DCU to a thread with parallel tense, are employed (See (Kameyama et al. , 1993; Poesio, 1994) for details), and the resulting ratings are factored into the rating for each thread. 
These rules for French are similar to rules for English proposed in (Grover et al. , 1995; Song and Cohen, 1991; Kameyama et al. , 1993), but 1We have defined 89 rules, divided in 29 levels. 
This will be enriched later with a notion of temporal focus, following for instance (Kameyama et al. , 1993; Song and Cohen, 1991), and a notion of temporal perspective necessary to capture more complex tense interactions. 
The method combines a constraint-based approach with an approach based on preferences: we exploit the HPSG type hierarchy and unification to arrive at a temporal structure using constraints placed on that structure by tense, aspect, rhetorical structure and temporal expressions, and we use the temporal centering preferences described by (Kameyama et al. , 1993; Poesio, 1994) to rate the possibilities for temporal structure and choose' the best among them.

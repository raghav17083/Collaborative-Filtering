In Fahmi and Bouma (2006) it is shown that syntactic patterns can be used to extract potential definition sentences from Wikipedia, and that syntactic features of these sentences (in combination with obvious clues such as the position of the sentence in the document) can be used to improve the accuracy of an automatic classifier which distinguishes definitions from non-definitions in the extracted data set. 
Fahmi and Bouma (2006) combine pattern matching and machine learning. 
43 2 Related Work Definition extraction is an important NLP task, most frequently a subtask of terminology extraction (Pearson, 1996), the automatic creation of glossaries (Klavans and Muresan, 2000; Klavans and Muresan, 2001), question answering (Miliaraki and Androutsopoulos, 2004; Fahmi and Bouma, 2006), learning lexicalsemanticrelations(Malaiseetal. 
Fahmi and Bouma (2006) combined a rulebased approach and machine learning for the detection of is definitions in Wikipedia articles. 
For example, (Fahmi and Bouma, 2006) report that a system trained on 2299 sentences, including 1366 definition sentences, may increase the accuracy of a definition extraction tool from 59% to around 90%.12 Another possible improvement may consist in, again, aiming at very high recall and then using an independent keyword detector to mark keywords (and key phrases) in text and classifying as genuine definitions those definitions, whose defined term has been marked as a keyword.

4) and other-than contexts (footnote 2), in which the antecedents are available structurally and thus a relatively unsophisticated procedure would suffice to find them; (b) idiomatic and discourse connective other, e.g., on the other 3 In parallel, efforts have been made to enrich WordNet by adding information in glosses (Harabagiu et al. , 1999). 
For example, in eXtended WordNet (Harabagiu et al. 1999), the glosses in WordNet are enriched by disambiguating the nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives with synsets. 
9 P k (Beeferman et al. , 1999) evaluates the probability that a randomly chosen pair of words, separated by k words, is wrongly classified, i.e. they are found in the same segment by TOPICOLL, while they are actually in different ones (miss of a document break), or they are found in different segments, while they are actually in the same one (false alarm). 
These new tasks include identification of semantic roles as in FrameNet (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002), disambiguation of WordNet glosses (Miller 1990; Fellbaum 1998; Harabagiu, Miller et al. 1999), automatic acquisitio n of subcategorisation frames (Korhonen 2002; Preiss and Korhonen 2002), and Logic al Form Identific ation (LFI) (Rus 2002; Rus and Moldovan 2002). 
This seems to be due to lack of topical context (Harabagiu et al. , 1999; Agirre et al. , 2001) as well as local context (Fellbaum, 1998).

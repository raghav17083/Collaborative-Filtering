Introduction Many applications that process natural language can be enhanced by incorporating information about the probabilities of word strings; that is, by using statistical language model information (Church et al. 1991; Church and Mercer 1993; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Liddy and Paik 1992). 
This can be done by smoothing the observed frequencies 7 (Church and Mercer 1993) or by class-based methods (Brown et al. 1991; Pereira and Tishby 1992; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Hirschman 1986; Resnik 1992; Brill et al. 1990; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993). 
Another problem that affects the corpus-based WSD methods is the sparseness of data: these methods typically rely on the statistics of cooccurrences of words, while many of the possible cooccurrences are not observed even in a very large corpus (Church and Mercer, 1993).

This can be done by smoothing the observed frequencies (Church and Mercer, 1993), or by class-based methods (Brown et al. , 1991; Pereira and Tishby, 1992; Pereira et ah, 1993; Hirschman, 1986; Resnik, 1992; Brill et ah, 1990; Dagan et al. , 1993).

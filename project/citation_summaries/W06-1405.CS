A distinct line of research has explored methods for automatically generating language that varies along personality dimensions, targeting applications such as computer gaming and educational virtual worlds (Andre et al. , 2000; Isard et al. , 2006; Loyall and Bates, 1997; Piwek, 2003; Walker et al. , 1997) inter alia. 
(Isard et al., 2006) model personality and alignment in generated dialogues between pairs of agents using OpenCCG and an over-generation and ranking approach, guided by a set of language models. 
The algorithm has been implemented as an extension to the OpenCCG hybrid symbolic/statistical realizer, and has recently been employed to generate n-best realization lists for reranking according to their predicted synthesis quality (Nakatsu and White, 2006), as well as to generate dialogues exhibiting individuality and alignment(Brockmann et al. , 2005; Isard et al. , 2005). 
The closest work to ours is probably Isard et al.s CRAG2 system (2006), which overgenerates and ranks using ngram language models trained on a corpus labelled for all Big Five personality dimensions. 
4 Conclusion We present a new method for generating linguistic variation projecting multiple personality traits continuously, by combining and extending previous research in statistical natural language generation (Paiva and Evans, 2005; Rambow et al., 2001; Isard et al., 2006; Mairesse and Walker, 2007).

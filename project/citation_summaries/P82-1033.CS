Marcus (1982) envisages the following alternatives: a) the use of special "un-grammatical" rules, which explicitly encode facts about non-standard usage b) the use of "meta-rules" to relax the constraints imposed by classes of rules of the grammar c) allowing flexible interaction between syntax and semantics, so that semantics can directly ana lyze substrings of syntactic fragments or indi vidual words when full syntactic analysis fails.

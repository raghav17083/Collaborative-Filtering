Also, techniques for extracting SF information fiom data can be used along with other research which aims to discover relationships between different SFs of a verb (Stevenson and Merlo, t999; Lapata and Brew, 1999; Lapata, 1999; Stevenson et al. , 1999). 
This is often termed as the classification of verb diathesis roles or the lexical semantics of predicates in natural language (see (Levin, 1993; McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999; Stevenson et al. , 1999; Lapata, 1999; Lapata and Brew, 1999; Schulte im Walde, 2000)). 
Many recent results, however, seem to converge in supporting the view that the relation between lexical syntax and semantics can be usefully exploited (Aone and McKee 1996; Dorr 1997; Dorr, Garman, and Weinberg 1995; Dorr and Jones 1996; Lapata and Brew 1999; Schulte im Walde 2000; Siegel 1998; Siegel 1999). 
Verbs in our data were mapped into their corresponding Levin classes (feature VL); polysemous verbs were disambiguated by the method proposed in Lapata and Brew (1999). 
Some of this work has focused on subcategorization patterns as the clear syntactic cue to an alternation (Lapata, 1999; Lapata and Brew, 1999; Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002).

Clark (2001) reports 42.0% unlabeled f-score on the same data using distributional clustering, and Klein and Manning (2002) obtain 51.2% unlabeled f-score on ATIS part-of-speech strings using a constituent-context model called CCM. 
Researchers have explored this problem for a variety of reasons: to argue empirically against the poverty of the stimulus (Clark, 2001), to use induction systems as a first stage in constructing large treebanks (van Zaanen, 2000), or to build better language models (Baker, 1979; Chen, 1995). 
1 Introduction There has been a great deal of work on unsupervised grammar induction, with motivations ranging from scientific interest in language acquisition to engineering interest in parser construction (Carroll and Charniak, 1992; Clark, 2001). 
Where van Zaanen (2000) achieved 39.2% unlabeled f-score on ATIS word strings, Clark (2001) reports 42.0% on the same data, and Klein and Manning (2002) obtain 51.2% f-score on ATIS part-of-speech strings using a constituent-context model called CCM. 
For a subtle discussion on this issue, see Clark (2001) or Klein (2005).

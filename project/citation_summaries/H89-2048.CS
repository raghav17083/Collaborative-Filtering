Although the systems of Wasson and Riley (1989) report slightly better error rates, our approach has the advantage of flexibility for application to new text genres, small training sets (and hence fast training times), (relatively) small storage requirements, and little manual effort. 
Riley (1989) describes an approach that uses regression trees (Breiman et al. 1984) to classify periods according to the following features:  Probability\[word preceding "". 
The best performance on the Brown corpus, a 0.2% error rate, was reported by Riley (1989), who trained a decision tree classifier on a 25-million-word corpus. 
Thus, the second class of SBD systems employs machine learning techniques such as decision tree classifiers (Riley, 1989), maximum entropy modeling (MAXTERMINATOR) (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997), neural networks (SATZ) (Palmer and Hearst, 1997), etc Machine learning systems treat the SBD task as a classification problem, using features such as word spelling, capitalization, suffix, word class, etc. , found in the local context of potentim sentence breaking punctuation. 
The splitting rules in the implementation employed for this study (Riley, 1989) approximate optimality by choosing at each node the split which minimizes the prediction error rate on the training data.

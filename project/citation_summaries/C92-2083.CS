They were pre-processors of learning \[Zernik & Jacobs, 199(I; Pustcjovsky et al. , 1199;t; Montemagni & Vanderwende, 19921 Sanfilippo & Pozanski, 1992; Zernik, 1989\] or post-processors of learning \[Smadja, \]991\]. 
The program consults a lexical database which contains approximately 150,000 semantic associations between word senses, the result of autonmtically parsing the definition text of each noun and verb sense in LDOCE and then applying a set of heuristic rules which antomatically attempt to identify any systematic semantic relationships holding between a headword and the (base forms of) words used to define it (Jensen & Binot, 1987; Montemagni and Vanderwende, 1992).

In these works, the definitions are analyzed using either a parser (Montemagni and Vanderwende 1992) or a pattern matcher (Ahlswede and Evens 1988) into semantic relations. 
\]'he algorithm described here, therefore, relies on semantic information which has been extracted automatically fi'om an on-line dictionary (see Montemagni and Vanderwende, 1992; l)ohm et al. , 1993).

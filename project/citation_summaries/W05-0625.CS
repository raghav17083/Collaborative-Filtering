These were first annotated with semantic roles using a stateof-the-art semantic role labeling system (Koomen et al., 2005). 
An important consideration within this general SRL architecture is the combination of systems and input annotations.Most SRL systems include some kind of combination to increase robustness, gain coverage, and reduce effects of parse errors.One may combine: (1) the output of several independent SRL basic systems (Surdeanu et al.2007; Pradhan et al.2005b), or (2) several outputs from the same SRL system obtained by changing input annotations or other internal parameters (Koomen et al. 2005; Toutanova, Haghighi, and Manning 2005).The combination can be as simple as selecting the best among the set of complete candidate solutions, but usually consists of combining fragments of alternative solutions to construct the nal output.Finally, the combination component may involve machine learning or not.The gain in performance from the combination step is consistently between two and three F 1 points.However, a combination approach increases system complexity and penalizes efciency. 
Its architecture is based on the top system in the 2005 CoNLL shared task (Koomen et al. , 2005), modified to process raw text using lower level processors but maintaining 6 good real time performance. 
It is generally formulated as a semantic role labeling (SRL) task, where each argument of the predicate is assigned a label that represents the semantic role it plays with regard to its predicate (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Hacioglu et al. , 2003; Pradhan et al. , 2004b; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Toutanova et al. , 2005; Koomen et al. , 2005). 
3.5 Blending and Post-Processing Combining the output from several different systems has been shown to be beneficial (Koomen et al., 2005).

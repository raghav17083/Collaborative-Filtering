3.1 THE COMPOSlTIONALITY PRINCIPLE IN MACHINE TRANSLATION Most machine translation systems (Slocum 1985) aiming at practical use employ the transfer method, which divides Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 2, June 1990 73 Taijiro Tsutsumi Intermediate Representations in Machine Translation the whole process into three phases: analysis of the source language, transfer between intermediate representations, and generation of the target language. 
However, few machine translation systems have so far had a comprehensive component for wide-range restructuring (Slocum 1985), mainly because many systems are presently designed to produce output that is at best "fair," and little effort has been devoted to obtaining "good" output or natural sentences. 
Bracketing with ordinary parentheses is treated in the LRC system (Bennett and Slocum 1985) by reliance on LISP's handling of parentheses. 
The score can be the number of constraints satisfied by the interpretation (Wilks 1973, Fass & Wilks 1983), where these constraints might be assigned relative weights by the linguist (Robinson 1982, Charniak 1983, Bennett and Slocum 1985) or calculated by the computer (Papegaaij 1986). 
1 INTRODUCTION Much effort has been devoted to research into, and development of, machine translation since the 1950s (Slocum 1985).

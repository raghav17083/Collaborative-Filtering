Our work has been heavily influenced by (Gabsdil and Lemon, 2004), (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2002), (Walker et al., 2000), and (Chotimongkol and Rud12 nicky, 2001) all of which demonstrate the utility of training a classifier with features derived from the natural language and dialogue management components of a spoken dialogue system to better predict the quality of speech recognition results. 
However, the way that seems most appealing is how (Gabsdil & Lemon, 2004) and (Hacioglu & Ward, 2001) re-rank N-Best lists based on dialogue context achieving a considerable improvement in recognition performance. 
Recent work has shown that dialogue design can benefit from several higher level dialogue factors: dialogue acts (Frampton and Lemon, 2005; Walker et al. , 2001), pragmatic plausibility (Gabsdil and Lemon, 2004). 
These labels were learned in a similar way to (Gabsdil and Lemon, 2004) and correspond to varying levels of confidence, being essentially potential directives to the dialogue manager. 
The work described in (Gabsdil and Lemon, 2004) is especially relevant, because, as in our experiments, the dialogue system of interest provides for map-based multimodal dialogue.

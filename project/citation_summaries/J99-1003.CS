Following previous researchers in computational linguistics (Bergsma and Kondrak, 2007; Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Melamed, 1999), however, we adopted a simplified definition which ignores origin, defining cognates as words in different languages that are mutual translations and have a similar orthography. 
In statistical machine translation, cognates are helpful in inducing translation lexicons (Koehn and Knight, 2001; Mann and Yarowsky, 2001), sentence alignment (Melamed, 1999), and word alignment (Tiedemann, 2003). 
Melamed (1999) normalized LCS by dividing the length of the longest common subsequence by the length of the longer string and called it longest common subsequence ratio (LCSR). 
While linguists define cognates as words derived from a common root3 (Bickford and Tuggy, 2002), computational linguists typically ignore origin, defining them as words in different languages that are mutual translations and have a similar orthography (Bergsma and Kondrak, 2007; Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Melamed, 1999). 
 similarity-based: inspired by sentence alignment for multilingual parallel corpora in Machine Translation (Church, 1993; Fung and Church, 1994; Melamed, 1999), we view the alignment between sentences from summaries and sentences from nonsummaries as the alignment of monolingual parallel texts at the sentence level.

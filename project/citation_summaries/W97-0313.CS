Weakly supervised learning methods for semantic lexicon generation have utilized co-occurrence statistics (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Roark and Charniak, 1998), syntactic information (Tanev and Magnini, 2006; Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004; Phillips and Riloff, 2002), lexico-syntactic contextual patterns (e.g., resides in <location> or moved to <location>) (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002), and local and global contexts (Fleischman and Hovy, 2002). 
771 Riloff and Shepherd (1997) used a semiautomatic method for discovering similar words using a few seed examples by using pattern-based techniques and human supervision. 
This problem is addressed by Riloff and Shepherd (1997), Roark and Charniak (1998) and more recently by Widdows and Dorow (2002). 
One is automatic thesaurus acquisition, that is, to identify synonyms or topically related words from corpora based on various measures of similarity (e.g. Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Thelen and Riloff, 2002). 
Our approach builds upon earlier work on corpus-based methods for generating extraction patterns (Riloff, 1996b) and semantic lexicons (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997).

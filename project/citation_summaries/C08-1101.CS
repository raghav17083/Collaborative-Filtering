Several researchers have recognized the important role discourse plays in opinion analysis (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2005; Snyder and Barzilay, 2007; Somasundaran et al., 2008; Asher et al., 2008; Sadamitsu et al., 2008). 
Amount of works have been done on sentimental classification in different levels (Zhang et al., 2009; Somasundaran et al., 2008; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al., 2005). 
Researchers, such as (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006), have discussed how the discourse structure can influence opinion interpretation; and previous work, such as (Asher et al., 2008; Somasundaran et al., 2008), have developed annota170 tion schemes for interpreting opinions with discourse relations. 
Previous work on emotion and subjectivity detection in multi-party conversations has explored using prosodic information (Neiberg et al., 2006), combining linguistic and acoustic information (Raaijmakers et al., 2008) and combining lexical and dialog information (Somasundaran et al., 2007). 
The former is a task of identifying positive and negative sentiments from a text which can be a passage, a sentence, a phrase and even a word (Somasundaran et al., 2008; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al., 2005).

However, unestablished compounds are common: almost 70% of compounds identied in the BNC co-occur with a frequency of only one (Lapata and Lascarides, 2003).


Finally, we plan to enhance our text annotation based on noun-compound disambiguation (Lapata and Lascarides, 2003).


For example, over half of the two-noun NC types in the BNC occur just once (Lapata and Lascarides, 2003).

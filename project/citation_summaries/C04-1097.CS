Edit distance related di, di = 1  mN where m is the minimum number of deletions combined with insertions to get to the right order (Ringger et al., 2004). 
There are linearization methods developed for German which find an optimal word order for a sentence (Ringger et al., 2004; Filippova & Strube, 2007).

Moser and Moore (1995a) and Moser and Moore (1995b) investigated the relationship between cue placement and selection. 
This is better than that mentioned in (Moser and Moore, 1995b). 
So far, the annotation of discourse structure of documents has been applied primarily to identifying topical segments (Hearst, 1997), inter-sentential relations (Nomoto and Matsumoto, 1999; Tsou et al. , 2000), and hierarchical analyses of small corpora (Moser and Moore, 1995; Marcu et al. , 1999). 
The types of linguistic features investigated indude prosody (Grosz and Hirschberg 1992; Nakatani, Hirschberg, and Grosz 1995; Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996; Swerts 1995; Swerts and Ostendorf 1995), term repetition (Hearst 1994), cue words (Moser and Moore 1995; Whittaker and Stenton 1988), and discourse anaphora (Walker and Whittaker 1990). 
This conclusion is the same as (Quirk and Greenbaum and Leech and Svartvik, 1972) and (Moser and Moore, 1995b) opinion, i.e., because typically occurs in the second span.

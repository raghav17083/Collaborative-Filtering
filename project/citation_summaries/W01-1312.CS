Previous work on temporal inference has focused on the automatic tagging of temporal expressions (e.g. , Wilson et al. 2001) or on learning the ordering of events from manually annotated data (e.g. , Mani et al. 2003). 
A few tasks can be distinguished in that respect: detecting dates and temporal markers detecting event descriptions finding the date of events described figuring out the temporal relations between events in a text The first task is not too difficult when looking for dates, e.g. using regular expressions (Wilson et al. , 2001), but requires some syntactic analysis in a larger framework (Vazov, 2001; Shilder and Habel, 2001). 
Absolute temporal information has received some attention (Wilson et al. , 2001; Schilder and Habel, 2001; Wiebe et al. , 1998) and systems have been developed for identifying and assigning referents to time expressions. 
Among others, (Moia, 2001; Wilson et al. , 2001; Negri and Marseglia, 2004) emphasized the potentialities of such applications for different information retrieval related tasks. 
To the best of our knowledge, only (Li et al. , 2001) and (Mani and Wilson, 2000) mention having tried this kind of annotation, as a side job for their temporal expressions mark-up systems.

3.2 Translation and Translation Lattices The lattice of possible translations of a26 a27a7 is obtained using the weighted finite state composition: a6 a30 a23a25a112 a132 a122 a24 a122 a0 a122 a2 a122a8a7 a49 (22) The translation with the highest probability (Equation 20) can now be computed by obtaining the path with the highest score in a6 . In terms of AT&T FSM tools, this can be done as follows fsmbestpath a6 a35 fsmproject a15 a93 a35 a0 fsmrmepsilon a1 a110 a3 A translation lattice (Ueffing et al. , 2002) can be generated by pruning a6 based on likelihoods or number of states. 
3.1 Generation of word graphs A word graph is a weighted directed acyclic graph, in which each node represents a partial translation hypothesis and each edge is labelled with a word of the target sentence and is weighted according to the scores given by an SMT model (see (Ueffing et al., 2002) for more details). 
The SMT systems decoder is a graph-based decoder (Ueffing et al. , 2002; Zhang et al. , 2004). 
Translation lattices (Ueffing et al. , 2002; Kumar and Byrne, 2003) are a compact representation of a large set of most likely translations generated by an MT system. 
3.3 Generation of Word Graphs The generation of word graphs for a bottom-top search with the IBM constraints is described in (Ueffing et al. , 2002).

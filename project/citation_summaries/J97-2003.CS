Therefore, CFGs used in spoken-dialogue applications often represent regular languages (Church, 1983; Brown and Buntschuh, 1994), either by construction or as a result of a finite-state approximation of/~ more general CFG (Pereira and Wright, 1997).t Assuming that the grammar can be efficiently converted into a finite automaton, appropriate techniques can then be used to combine it with other finite-state recognition models for use in real-time recognition (Mohri et al., 1998b). 
This two-way power of the finite-state transducer (Mohri, 1997) has significantly reduced the amount of efforts to build the HUMT system. 
Note that in transitioning from recognizers to transducers we are following the convention established in (Mohri, 1997) where a transducer with weight outputs is used to represent a weighted recognizer. 
Equivalence is efficiently tested by pushing the (deterministic) automata to canonicalize their arc labels and then testing unweighted equivalence (Mohri, 1997). 
On average, the determinized forests contain 13.7% of the original 3 As in (Mohri, 1997), determinization may be applicable to some automata that recognize infinite languages.

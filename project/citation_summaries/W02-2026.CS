2 Related Work The literature on translation lexicon induction for low-density languages falls in to two broad categories: 1) Effectively utilizing similarity between languages by choosing a high-resource bridge language for translation (Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002) and 2) Extracting noisy clues (such as similar context) from monolingual corpora with help of a seed lexicon (Rapp, 1999; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002, Haghighi et al., 2008). 
Pivot Language methods were also used for translation dictionary induction (Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002), word sense disambiguation (Diab and Resnik, 2002), and so on. 
Schafer and Yarowsky (2002) induced translation lexicons for languages without common parallel corpora using a bridge language that is related to the target languages. 
Schafer and Yarowsky, (2002) independently proposed using frequency, orthographic similarity and also showed improvements using temporal and wordburstiness similarity measures, in addition to context. 
Also related are the areas of word alignment for machine translation (Och and Ney, 2000), induction of translation lexicons (Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002), and cross-language annotation projections to a second language (Riloff et al., 2002; Hwa et al., 2002; Mohammad et al., 2007).

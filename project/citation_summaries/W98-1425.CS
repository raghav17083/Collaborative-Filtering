Busemann and Horacek (1998) describe a system that mixes templates and rulebased generation. 
Consequently, "shallow surface generators" have recently appeared (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997) (Busemann and Horacek, 1998) that require an input considerably less abstract than those required by more traditional realization components such as SURGE (E1hadad and Robin, 1996) or KPML (Bateman, 1997). 
In Busemann and Horacek (1998), the remaining output is generated by grammar rules. 
2 What TG/2 is and What it isnt TG/2 has been described originally in [Busemann, 1996; Busemann and Horacek, 1998] as a template-based generator. 
Unfortunately, the development burden of implementing the translation between the systems available semantic representations and the required input format can be quite substantial(BusemannandHoracek, 1998).

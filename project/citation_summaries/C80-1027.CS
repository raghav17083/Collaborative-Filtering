INow at Automated Language Processing Systems, Provo, Utah 41 RESULTS AND COMPARISON TO OTIIER STUDIES We are reporting only a small subset of our results, those to be compared to the results of Thompson (1980) and of Chafe (~.982). 
Our hypotheses and strategies were motivated by an analysis of naturally occurring dialogs from several domains, including a radio call-in show 4 providing advice on investments, interactions with the REL (Thompson 1980) natural language interface to a ship data base, and student advisement sessions. 
(Notable exceptions include Fromkin (1980), and Thompson (1980)). 
Thompson's (1980) extensive tabulation of utterance forms in a multiple modality comparison overlaps our analysis at the level of syntax. 
For instance, in an extensive study (Thompson 1980) including 1615 inputs, only 1093 were parsable, and an overall total of 446 contained various kinds of errors: 161 with vocabulary problems, 72 with punctuation errors, 62 with ungrammaticality, and 61 with Copyright 1984 by the Association for Computational Linguistics.

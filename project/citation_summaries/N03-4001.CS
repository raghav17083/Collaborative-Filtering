The eViTAP system currently processes Arabic sources using statistical machine translation systems from IBM (Al-Onaizan 2003) and Language Weaver (Benjamin et al. 2003).


The block set is generated using a phrase-pair selection algorithm similar to (Koehn et al. , 2003; Al-Onaizan et al. , 2004), which includes some heuristic filtering to mal statement here.

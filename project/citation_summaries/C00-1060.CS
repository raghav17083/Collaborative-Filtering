Most of the previous statistical approaches for Japanese dependency analysis (Fujio and Matsumoto, 1998; Haruno et al. , 1999; Uchimoto et al. , 1999; Kanayama et al. , 2000; Uchimoto et al. , 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000) are based on a probabilistic model consisting of the following two steps. 
(To parse texts, we use a downgraded version of an existing parser (Kanayama et al. , 2000) throughout this work). 
A number of statistical and machine learning approaches, such as Maximum Likelihood estimation (Fujio and Matsumoto, 1998), Decision Trees (Haruno et al. , 1999), Maximum Entropy models (Uchimoto et al. , 1999; Uchimoto et al. , 2000; Kanayama et al. , 2000), and Support Vector Machines (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000), have been applied to estimate these probabilities. 
143 accuracy (dependency) accuracy (sentence) # failure (Kanayama et al. , 2000) 88.6% (23078/26062) 46.9% (1560/3326) 1.4% (46/3372) This paper 85.0% (13201/15524) 37.4% (705/1887) 1.4% (26/1913) Table 2: Accuracy of dependency analysis. 
Our group has developed a wide-coverage HPSG grammar for Japanese (Mitsuishi et al. , 1998), which is used in a high-accuracy Japanese dependency analyzer (Kanayama et al. , 2000).

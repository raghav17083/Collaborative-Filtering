Ranking algorithms may be rule-based (e.g., the one using a threshold on distributional similarity in (Pasca et al., 2006)) or ML-based (e.g., the SVM model in (Mirkin et al., 2006) for combining pattern-based and distributional features). 
First, merging classic approaches to taxonomic and relational similarity, we represent concept pairs by a vector that concatenates information about the contexts in which the two words occur independently, and the contexts in which they co-occur (Mirkin et al. 2006 also integrate information from the lexical patterns in which two words co-occur and similarity of the contexts in which each word occurs on its own, to improve performance in lexical entailment acquisition). 
These results corroborate those found in (Mirkin et al., 2006), where this ML-based combination was reported to be significantly better than a rule-based one on the task of lexical entailment acquisition. 
This definition is similar to (Mirkin et al., 2006) and is calculated as: fPk (w1,w2) = P(pk|w1,w2) = N(w1,w2,pk)N(w 1,w2) . 
When combined with pattern-based features, DSIM-PAT showed a slight recall increase compared to DSIM, partially reconfirming the favorable integration result of (Mirkin et al., 2006).

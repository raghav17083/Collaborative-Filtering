MUC-7 has also seen hybrids of statistical NERs and hand-coded systems (Mikheev et al. , 1998; Borthwick, 1999), notably Mikheev's system, which achieved the best performance of 93.39% on the official NE test data. 
The EDR has close ties to the named entity recognition (NER) and coreference resolution tasks, which have been the focus of several recent investigations (Bikel et al. , 1997; Miller et al. , 1998; Borthwick, 1999; Mikheev et al. , 1999; Soon et al. , 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Florian et al. , 2004), and have been at the center of evaluations such as: MUC-6, MUC-7, and the CoNLL02 and CoNLL03 shared tasks. 
2.2.4 Abstracts A number of NER systems have made effective use of how the same token was tagged in different parts of the same document (see (Curran and Clark, 2003) and (Mikheev et al. , 1999)). 
2 Approaches to NER There has been a considerable amount of work on NER in English (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002; Zhang and Johnson, 2003; Petasis et al., 2001; Mikheev et al., 1999). 
The Entity Detection and Tracking task (EDT henceforth) has close ties to the named entity recognition (NER) and coreference resolution tasks, which have been the focus of attention of much investigation in the recent past (Bikel et al. , 1997; Borthwick et al. , 1998; Mikheev et al. , 1999; Miller et al. , 1998; Aberdeen et al. , 1995; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Soon et al. , 2001), and have been at the center of several evaluations: MUC-6, MUC-7, CoNLL02 and CoNLL03 shared tasks.

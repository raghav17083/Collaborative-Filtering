However, it has been observed that ratings for different aspects can be correlated (Snyder and Barzilay, 2007), e.g., very negative opinion about room cleanliness is likely to result not only in a low rating for the aspect rooms, but also is very predictive of low ratings for the aspectsserviceanddining. 
Similarly, Snyder and Barzilay (2007) decompose an opinion across several dimensions and capture the sentiment across each dimension. 
Snyder and Barzilay (2007) combine an agreement model based on contrastive RST relations with a local aspect model to make a more informed overall decision for sentiment classification. 
Specifically, aspect rating as an interesting topic has also been widely studied (Titov and McDonald, 2008a; Snyder and Barzilay, 2007; Goldberg and Zhu, 2006). 
Several researchers have recognized the important role discourse plays in opinion analysis (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2005; Snyder and Barzilay, 2007; Somasundaran et al., 2008; Asher et al., 2008; Sadamitsu et al., 2008).

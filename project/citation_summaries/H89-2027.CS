BBN proposed the N-Best algorithm for speech recognition in (Chow and Schwartz, 1989). 
In searching for the best sequence of POS tags for the transcribed words, we follow the technique proposed by Chow and Schwartz (1989) and only keep a small number of alternative paths by pruning the low probability paths after processing each word. 
Spoken input is initially analyzed by the "N-best" algorithm(Chow and Schwartz, 1989), converting it into" a rank-ordered set of N best word-sequence hypotheses (for a given value of N). 
In searching for the best sequence of POS tags for the transcribed words, we follow the technique proposed by Chow and Schwartz (1989) and only keep a small number of alternative paths by pruning the low probability paths after processing each word.

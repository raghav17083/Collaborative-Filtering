We have developed the concept of the "at-a-glance" summary, and its realization in the Japanese language "phrase-representation summarizatiola" to achieve this goal (Ueda, et al. 2000).


In our work, we address the extraction problem at phrase-level [Ueda et al (2000), Wacholder et al (2000)], identifying salient information that is spread across multiple sentences and paragraphs.

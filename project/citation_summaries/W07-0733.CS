W08-0320:1	26:89	Following (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007), we further used two phrase tables.
---------------------------------------------------
W09-0414:2	21:78	2.1 Translation models interpolation We implemented a TM interpolation strategy following the ideas proposed in (Schwenk and Estve, 2008), where the authors present a promising technique of target LMs linear interpolation; in (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007) where a log-linear combination of TMs is performed; and specifically in (Foster and Kuhn, 2007) where the authors present various ways of TM combination and analyze in detail the TM domain adaptation.
---------------------------------------------------
W09-0421:3	41:117	Based on Koehn and Schroeder (2007) we adapted our system from last year, which was focused on Europarl, to perform well on test data 2Machinese syntax, from Connexor Oy http://www.
---------------------------------------------------
W09-0405:4	48:116	Although the Moses decoder is able to work with two phrase tables at once (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007), it is difficult to use this method when there is more than one additional model.
---------------------------------------------------
W08-0309:5	48:288	For instance, statistical systems are heavily optimized to their training data, and do not perform as well on out-of-domain data (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007).

---------------------------------------------------

W08-0321:11	56:99	(4) 3.3 Genre-Dependent Sentence Pair Confidence Genre adaptation is one of the major challenges in statistical machine translation since translation models suffer from data sparseness (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
W09-0432:12	37:179	In (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007) cross-domain adaptation techniques were applied on a phrasebased SMT trained on the Europarl task, in order to translate news commentaries, from French to English.
---------------------------------------------------
W09-0432:13	43:179	Interpolation of multiple phrase tables is applied in a more principled way than in (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007): all entries are merged into one single table, corresponding feature functions are concatenated and smoothing is applied when observations are missing.
---------------------------------------------------
W09-0432:14	41:179	Our work is mostly related to (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007) but explores different assumptions about available adaptation data: i.e. only monolingual in-domain texts are available.
---------------------------------------------------
W08-0327:15	26:70	Work on domain adaptation for statistical machine translation (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007) tries to bring solutions to this issue.
---------------------------------------------------
W09-2404:16	34:142	In machine translation, discourse level information has only been indirectly used by adaptation of translation or language models to specific genre or topics (e.g., Foster and Kuhn (2007); Koehn and Schroeder (2007)).
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1079:17	100:222	3.5 Domain adaptation in Machine Translation Within MT there has been a variety of approaches dealing with domain adaption (for example (Wu et al., 2008; Koehn and Schroeder, 2007).

While many approaches have addressed this problem, our work is most closely related to that of (Raina et al., 2005; MacCartney and Manning, 2007; Tatu and Moldovan, 2006; Braz et al., 2005), which convert the inputs into logical forms and then attempt to prove H from T plus a set of axioms. 
We achieve overall accuracy of 70.49%, representing a 27% error reduction from (MacCartney and Manning, 2007). 
Although this is only true in cases where y occurs in an upward monotone context (MacCartney and Manning, 2007), in practice genuine contradictions between y-values sharing a meronym relationship are extremely rare. 
To facilitate comparison with previous work, we have evaluated our system using a version of the FraCas data prepared by (MacCartney and Manning, 2007), in which multiple-premise problems (44% of the total) and problems lacking a hypothesis or a well-defined answer (3% of the total) are excluded; question sentences have been converted 525  ID Premise Hypothesis Ans 1 38 No delegate finished the report. 
2.3 Markov Logic Inference Rules HOLMES is given the following set of six domainindependent rules, which are similar to the upward monotone rules introduced by (MacCartney and Manning, 2007).

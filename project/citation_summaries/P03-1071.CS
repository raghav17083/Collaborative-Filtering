Our work is also related to text segmentation (Ji et al., 2003) and meeting segmentation (Malioutov et al., 2006; Malioutov et al., 2007; Galley et al., 2003; Eisenstein et al., 2008). 
4 Related Approaches We compare our approach to the LCseg algorithm which uses lexical chains to estimate topic boundaries (Galley et al. , 2003). 
2 Related work Previous approaches to story segmentation have largely focused lexical features, such as word similarily (Kozima, 1993), cue phrases (Passonneau and Litman, 1997), cosine similarity of lexical windows (Hearst, 1997; Galley et al. , 2003), and adaptive language modeling (Beeferman et al. , 1999). 
We show how Bayesian inference in this generative model can be used to simultaneously address the problems of topic segmentation and topic identification: automatically segmenting multi-party meetings into topically coherent segments with performance which compares well with previous unsupervised segmentation-only methods (Galley et al. , 2003) while simultaneously extractingtopicswhichratehighlywhenassessed for coherence by human judges. 
5 Experiments 5.1 Data The first TDT collection is part of the LCseg toolkit1 (Galley et al. , 2003) and we used it to compare our approach to LCseg.

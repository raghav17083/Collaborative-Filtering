The probabilistic model is a neural network statistical parser (Henderson, 2003), and the data-defined kernel is a TOP reranking kernel (Henderson and Titov, 2005). 
This parsing model is also a good candidate for our experiments because it achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard Wall Street Journal (WSJ) parsing problem (Henderson, 2003), and data-defined kernels derived from this parsing model have recently been used with the Voted Perceptron algorithm on the WSJ parsing task, achieving a significant improvement in accuracy over the neural network parser alone (Henderson and Titov, 2005). 
Also, as with any generative model, it should be easy to improve the parsers accuracy with discriminative reranking, such as discriminative retraining techniques (Henderson, 2004) or data-defined kernels (Henderson and Titov, 2005), with or even without the introduction of any additional linguistic features. 
For a detailed description of the experiment setup, we refer the reader to (Henderson and Titov, 2005). 
The TOP reranking kernel has been demonstrated to perform better than the Fisher kernel for the parse reranking task (Henderson and Titov, 2005).

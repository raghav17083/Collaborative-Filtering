In some of the submitted systems we used a discriminative word alignment model (DWA) to generate the alignments as described in Niehues and Vogel (2008) instead.


For more details see Niehues and Vogel (2008).


Niehues and Vogel (2008) propose a discriminative approach to modeling the alignment matrix directly.

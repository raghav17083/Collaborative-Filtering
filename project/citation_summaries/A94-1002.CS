This is the approach used in the systems TEXT (McKeown 1985), GENARO-MUMBLE (Conklin 1983; Meteer et al. 1987), PENMAN (The Penman NLG 1989), SPOKESMAN (Meteer 1990), EPICURE (Dale 1992), KALIPSOS (Nogier 1990) and in the generators based on the Meaning-Text Theory (MTT) (Mel'Suk and Pertsov 1987) such as: FOC (Bourbeau et al. 1990), GossIP (Carcagno and Iordanskaja 1993) and LFS (Iordanskaja et al. 1994). 
Other statistical systems \[Kupiec et al. 1995\], \[Rau et al. 1994\] have the same characteristics as Netsumm. 
CASPER has been used in an upgraded version of PLANDoc(McKeown et al., 1994), a robust, deployed system which generates reports for justifying the cost to the management in telecommunications domain. 
PLANDoc\[Kukich et al, 1994, McKeown et al. , 1994\] generates English summaries based on somewhat cryptic traces of the interaction between planning engineers and LEIS-PLAN TM. 
2 We have used this same model for lexical choice in other systems we have developed, such as COMET (McKeown et al. 1990), a multimedia explanation system for equipment maintenance and repair, and PLANDOC (Kukich et al. 1994), an automated documentation system under collaborative development with Bellcore.

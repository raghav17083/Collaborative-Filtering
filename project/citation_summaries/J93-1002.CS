Briscoe & Carroll have proposed using a probabilistic model specific to LR parsing (Briscoe and Carroll, 1993). 
In an experiment with a wide-coverage parsing system (Alvey NL Tools, ANLT) Briscoe and Carroll (1993) observed that half of the parse failures were caused by inaccurate subcategorization information in the lexicon. 
THE NON-DETERMINISTIC LR PARSER Briscoe & Carroll (1993) describe a methodology for constructing an LR parser for a unificationbased grammar, in which a CF 'backbone' grammar is automatically constructed from the unification grammar, a parse table is constructed from the backbone grammar, and a parser is driven by the table and further controlled by unification of the 'residue' of features in the unification grammar that are not encoded in the backbone. 
There have been many other attempts to process dictionary definitions using heuristic pattern matching (e.g., Chodorow et al. 1985), specially constructed definition parsers (e.g., WilLs et al. 1996, Vossen 1995), and even general coverage syntactic parsers (e.g., Briscoe and Carroll 1993). 
If, instead, this procedure returns a list of several possible actions with corresponding probabilities, we can then parse with a model similar to the probabilistic LR models described by Briscoe and Carroll (1993), where the probability of a parse tree is the product of the probabilities of each of the actions taken in its derivation.

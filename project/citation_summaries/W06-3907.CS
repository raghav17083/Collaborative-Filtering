Concerning the complements of clause-embedding verbs, these inferences are modelled via a lexical verb classification that basically distinguishes implicatives (manage to TRUE dont manage to FALSE) and factives (know that TRUE dont know that TRUE) (Nairn et al., 2006). 
To explain how this is possible, we introduce the notion of implicative contexts (Nairn et al., 2006), and claim that complement-taking nouns introduce a context for the complement, whereas no such context is created for the adjuncts. 
Many classes of verbs have already been identified and are incorporated into the system (Nairn et al., 2006): verbs relating to speech (e.g., say, report, etc.), implicative verbs such as manage and fail (Karttunen, 2007), and factive verbs (e.g. agree, realize, consider) (Vendler, 1967; Kiparsky and Kiparsky, 1971), to name a few. 
See (Nairn et al., 2006) for detailed discussion of possible implication signatures and how to propagate them through contexts. 
Notice that, in order to match the inference rules with two anchors, the number of the dependency 7See (Nairn et al., 2006) for a detailed analysis of these aspects.

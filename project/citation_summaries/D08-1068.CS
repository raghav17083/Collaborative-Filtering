2 possible to compactly specify probability distributions over complex relational domains, and has been successfully applied to unsupervised coreference resolution (Poon and Domingos, 2008) and other tasks. 
forms both Poon and Domingos (2008) (an unsupervised Markov Logic Network system which uses explicit constraints) and Finkel and Manning (2008) (a supervised system which uses ILP inference to reconcile the predictions of a pairwise classifier) on all comparable measures.11 Similarly, on the ACE2004-NWIRE dataset, we also outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised system of Poon and Domingos (2008). 
Poon and Domingos (Poon and Domingos, 2008) use an unsupervised technique based on joint inference across mentions and Markov logic as a representation language for their system on both MUC and ACE data. 
4 Related Work A large body of literature related to statistical methods for coreference resolution is available (Ng and Cardie, 2003; Yang et al., 2003; Ng, 2008; Poon and 5 Table 3: Results of document-level boosting Iteration Accuracy (%) 1 78.53 2 78.82 3 79.08 4 78.37 Domingos, 2008; McCallum and Wellner, 2003).

This is also the main reason why most summarization systems applied to news articles do not outperform a simple baseline that just uses the first 100 words of an article (Svore et al., 2007; Nenkova, 2005). 
Use of a thesaurus has also shown to improve results in automatic summarization, even in multi-document environments (McKeown et al., 1999) and other languages such as Portuguese (Leite et al., 2007). 
This is akin to bonus/stigma words (Neto et al., 2002; Leite et al., 2007; Pollock and Zamora, 1975; Goldstein et al., 1999). 
Linguistic features are today used mostly in summarization systems, and include the standard features sentence length, n-gram frequency, sentence position, proper noun identification, similarity to title, tf.idf, and so-called bonus/stigma words (Neto et al., 2002; Leite et al., 2007; Pollock and Zamora, 1975; Goldstein et al., 1999). 
Our approach not only outperformed a notoriously difficult baseline but also achieved similar performance to the approach of (Svore et al., 2007), without requiring their third-party data resources.

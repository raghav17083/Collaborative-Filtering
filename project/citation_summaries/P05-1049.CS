In natural language processing, label propagation has been used for document classification (Zhu, 2005), word sense disambiguation (Niu et al., 2005; Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff, 2007), and sentiment categorization (Goldberg and Zhu, 2006). 
The label propagation algorithm (Niu, et al. , 2005) was used to perform sense disambiguation by the use of both training data and test data. 
Many corpus based statistical methods have been proposed to solve this problem, including supervised learning algorithms (Leacock et al. , 1998; Towel and Voorheest, 1998), weakly supervised learning algorithms (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Li and Li, 2004; Mihalcea, 2004; Niu et al. , 2005; Park et al. , 2000; Yarowsky, 1995), unsupervised learning algorithms (or word sense discrimination) (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997; Schutze, 1998), and knowledge based algorithms (Lesk, 1986; McCarthy et al. , 2004). 
The Niu et al. work (Niu et al. , 2005) is most comparable to ours. 
In NLP, label propagation has been used for word sense disambiguation (Niu et al. , 2005), document classi cation (Zhu, 2005), sentiment analysis (Goldberg and Zhu, 2006), and relation extraction (Chen et al. , 2006).

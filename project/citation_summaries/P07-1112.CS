Indeed, the n-gram patterns used to extract these relational possibilities from corpora are not unlike the patterns used by Cimiano and Wenderoth (2007) to harvest qualia structures from the web. 
Though this value seems to be low, it is consistent with a mean agreement of 11,8% for a similar task reported in (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007), see section 3. 
Cimiano and Wenderoth (2007) also use a range of Hearst-like patterns to find text sequences in web-text that are indicative of the lexico-semantic properties of words; in particular, these authors use phrases like to * a new 524 NOUN and the purpose of NOUN is to * to identify the agentive and telic roles of given nouns, thereby fleshing out the nouns qualia structure as posited by Pustejovskys (1990) theory of the generative lexicon. 
Concerning relatedness measure, additional corpus-based measures such as Web-based measures (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007) or measures based on syntactic relations (Pustejovsky et al., 1993) could appear to be useful for improving the ranking of the extracted relations. 
The results of the human judgment experiment reported in (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007) suggest that the automatic acquisition of qualia structures is a difficult task.

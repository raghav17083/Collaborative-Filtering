(Chafe 1982); and spoken language exhibits regular patterns of false starts and hesitations (Hindle 1983, Kroch and Hindle 1982).


Previous investigations have concentrated on syntactic differences between spoken and written language (Hindle 1983, Kroch and Hindle 1982, Thompson 1980), with the goal of adapting parsing techniques to handle the syntax of spoken language.

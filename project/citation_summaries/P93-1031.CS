With regard to tailoring texts for different readers, a number of previous researchers have looked at tailoring generated texts according to whether the reader is a domain expert or a novice (for example [Paris, 1988; McKeown et al. , 1993; Milosavljevic and Oberlander, 1998]). 
In addition, some researchers have explored the use of both local context surrounding the hypothesized proper nouns (McDonald 1993; Coates-Stephens 1991) and the larger discourse context (Mani et al. 1993) to improve the accuracy of proper noun extraction when large known-word lists are not available. 
2This question is beyond the scope of this paper; the kind of approach I have in mind here is represented in \[DiMarco et al. 1993\], \[Hirst 1995\], \[Edmonds 1999\]. 
Modular pipeline architectures have a long history of use in text gen16 eration systems (Kukich, 1983a; McKeown, 1985; McDonald and Pustejovsky, 1986; Reiter, 1994), although recent work argues for the need for interaction between modules (Danlos, 1987; Rubinoff, 1992; McKeown et al. , 1993). 
Techniques for proper noun extraction include the use of regular grammars to delimit and identify proper nouns (Mani et al. 1993; Paik et al. 1994), the use of extensive name lists, place names, titles and "gazetteers" in conjunction with partial grammars in order to recognize proper nouns as unknown words in close proximity to known words (Cowie et al. 1992; Aberdeen et al. 1992), statistical training to learn, for example, Spanish names, from on-line corpora (Ayuso 474 Radev and McKeown Generating Natural Language Summaries et al. 1992), and the use of concept-based pattern matchers that use semantic concepts as pattern categories as well as part-of-speech information (Weischedel et al. 1993; Lehnert et al. 1993).

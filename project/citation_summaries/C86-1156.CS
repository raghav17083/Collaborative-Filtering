Johnson and Klein (1986) and Johnson and Kay (1990) show how "set-valued" features can be used to express Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp 1981) in a complex-feature based grammar formalism. 
Based on a proposal for the treatment of personal pronouns described in (Johnson and Klein, 1986) we will propose that the R-antecedent information explicitly describes the set of potential discourse markers available as antecedents for reflexives. 
For example, the analysis of conjunctions in LFG (Kaplan and Maxwell 1988b) and the formalizations of Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp 1981) presented in Johnson and Klein (1986) and Johnson and Kay (1990) require additional mechanisms for representing and manipulating aggregates or sets of values in ways that are beyond the capability of such "pure" attribute-value systems. 
However, it is designed in such a way, as will shortly become clear, that it could be extended without undue difficulty to include pronoun anaphora, using a treatment based on that in (Johnson and Klein, 1986). 
In order to process discourse, we have employed the technique known as 'threading', used by Johnson and Klein (1986), whereby discourse referents are carried from left to right among the constituents of a sentence, and from one sentence to the next.

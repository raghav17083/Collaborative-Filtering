(Bourigault, 1992; Daille et al. , 1994; Enguehard and Pantera, 1994; 3usteson and Katz, 1995; Lauriston, 1996), have achieved relative success over the years, the addition of suitable linguistic information has the potential to enhance results still further, particularly in the case of small corpora or very specialised domains, where statistical information may not be so accurate. 
Figure 1: Base NP Examples base noun phrases with initial determiners and modifiers removed: Justeson & Katz (1995) look for repeated phrases; Bourigault (1992) uses a handcrafted noun phrase grammar in conjunction with heuristics for finding maximal length noun phrases; Voutilainen's NPTool (1993) uses a handcrafted lexicon and constraint grammar to find terminological noun phrases that include phrase-final prepositional phrases. 
234 Bourigault (1992) reports a tool, LEXTER, for extracting terminologies from texts. 
From the above, only (Bourigault, 1992) does not use any statistical information. 
Multi-word ATR usually uses linguistic information in the form of a grammar that mainly allows noun phrases or compounds to be extracted as candidate terms: (Bourigault, 1992) extracts maximal-length noun phrases and their subgroups (depending on their grammatical structure and position) as candidate terms.

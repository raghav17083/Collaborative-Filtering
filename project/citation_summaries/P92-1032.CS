This process is similar to the use of general pseudowords (Gale et al. , 1992b; Gaustad, 2001; Nakov and Hearst, 2003), but has some essential differences. 
Introduction Word sense disambiguation has long been one of the major concerns in natural language processing area (e.g. , Bruce et al. , 1994; Choueka et al. , 1985; Gale et al. , 1993; McRoy, 1992; Yarowsky 1992, 1994, 1995), whose aim is to identify the correct sense of a word in a particular context, among all of its senses defined in a dictionary or a thesaurus. 
Percent agreement is defined in \[Gale et al. , 1992\] as the ratio of observed agreements with the majority opinion to possible agreements with the majority opinion. 
This default strategy has been advocated as the baseline performance level for comparison with WSD programs (Gale et al. , 1992). 
Various corpus-based approaches to word sense disambiguation have been proposed (Bruce and Wiebe 1994; Charniak 1993; Dagan and Itai 1994; Fujii et al. 1996; Hearst 1991; Karov and Edelman 1996; Kurohashi and Nagao 1994; Li, Szpakowicz, and Matwin 1995; Ng and Lee 1996; Niwa and Nitta 1994; Sch~itze 1992; Uramoto 1994b; Yarowsky 1995).

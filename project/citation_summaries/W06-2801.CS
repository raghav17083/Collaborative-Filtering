Amongthemmanykindsoflinguisticnetworkshave been studied: e.g., free word association networks (Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005), syllable networks (Soares et al. , 2005), thesaurus networks (Sigman 65 and Cecchi, 2002), and document networks (Mehler, 2006).


Because of its expressiveness it was utilized in modeling constituency structures (Pustylnikov, 2006) as well as nonlinear document structures (Mehler, 2007b).


Secondly, the majority of linguistic network studies is performed on English only  with some exceptions (Soares et al. , 2005; Ferrer i Cancho et al. , 2004; Mehler, 2006).


Recently, (Mehler, 2006) has shown that this characteristic varies a lot for different document networks and thus allows distinguishing linguistic networks which are homogeneously called small-worlds.

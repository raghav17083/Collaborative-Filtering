The model employed in (Li and Abe, 1996) is based on the assmnption that the word distribution within a class is a uniform distribution, i.e. every word in a same class is generated with an equal probability. 
Our clustering method improves upon the previous methods proposed by Brown et al and (Li and Abe, 1996), and filrthcrmore it can be used to derive a disambiguation method with overall disambiguation accuracy of 85.2%, which improves thc perforrnance of a state-of-the-art disambiguatiou method. 
The proposed method, in contrast, employs a model in which different words within a same class can have different conditional generation probabilities, and thus can classify words in a way that is not affected by words' absolute fl'equencies and resolve the problem faced by the method of (Li and Abe, 1996). 
We call the disambiguation method using these probability values 'NounClass-2l)C.' We also tried the analogous method using thesauruses constructed by the method of (Li and Abe, 1996) 3The method of (Li and Abe, 1995) outputs a 'tree cut model' in a given thesaurus with conditional probabilities attached to all the nodes in the tree cut. 
6 Related Work 6.1 Models We can restrict the hard clustering model (1) by assuming that words within a same class are generated with an equal probability, obtaining 1 1 P(,~, v) = P(C,, , C, ) . IC,, I IC,,l' which is equivalent to the model proposed by (Li and Abe, 1996).

Moriceau (2006) reports a system that addresses part of this problem by trying to rationalize different but similar answers to the user, but does not extend to a general-purpose equivalence identifier.


We already successfully conducted such an experiment for numerical data fusion (Moriceau, 2006).


More details about comparison rules are presented in (Moriceau, 2006).

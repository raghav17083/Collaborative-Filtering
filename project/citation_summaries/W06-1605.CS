2.2 Concept-distance In Mohammad and Hirst (2006b), we show how distributional profiles of concepts (DPCs) can be used to measure semantic distance. 
In this paper, we proposed hybrid methods (hybrid-sense-filtered-counts and hybridsense-proportional-counts) that combine word word co-occurrence information (traditional distributional similarity) with wordconcept cooccurrence information (Mohammad and Hirst, 2006), with soft constraints in such a manner that the method makes use of information encoded in the thesaurus when available, and degrades gracefully if the target word is not listed in the thesaurus. 
Mohammad and Hirst (2006b) used the DPC-based monolingual distributional measures of concept-distance to rank word pairs by their semantic similarity and to correct real-word spelling errors, attaining markedly better results than monolingual distributional measures of word-distance. 
Again we used Mohammad and Hirsts (2006) method along with Lins (1998) distributional measure to determine the distributional closeness of two thesaurus concepts. 
A new bootstrapped WCCM is created such that each cell mi j, corresponding to word weni and concept cenj, is populated with the number of times weni co-occurs with any word used in sense cenj . Mohammad and Hirst (2006a) used the DPCs created from the bootstrapped WCCM to attain near-upper-bound results in the task of determining word sense dominance.

However, the TDFS approach extends formalized and implemented proposals for default inheritance, such as DATR (Evans and Gazdar 1989, 1996) or any version based on asymmetric unification, in that the lexicon now consists of a set of TDFSs, as opposed to a set of (T)FSs; that is, it permits default specification to persist "beyond the lexicon" for exploitation during syntactic, semantic, or discourse level operations. 
KATR is based on DATR, a formal language for representing lexical knowledge designed and implemented by Roger Evans and Gerald Gazdar (Evans & Gazdar 1989). 
CONCLUSION The PI approach to morphologically conditioned phonological and orthographic variation relates linguistically to word grammar (Hudson 1984), word syntax (Selkirk 1982) and to prosodic phonologies, and derives its computational features from DATR (Evans & Gazdar 1989); formally it relates closely to object-oriented morphology (Daelemans 1987), paradigmatic morphology (Calder 1989), and Bird's constraintbased phonology (1990). 
In this paper we explore this suggestion by showing how the lexical knowledge representation language (LKRL) DA'lR (Evans & Gazdar, 1989a; Evans & Gazdar, 1989b) can be used to formulate a compact, hierarchical encoding of an \[-'lAG. 
The original publications on DATR sought to provide the language with (1) a formal theory of inference (Evans and Gazdar, 1989a) and (2) a model-theoretic semantics (Evans and Gazdar, 1989b).

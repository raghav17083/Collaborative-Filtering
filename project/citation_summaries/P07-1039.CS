4 Improved alignment by reordering Word alignment with Giza++ has been shown to improve from making the source and target language more similar, e.g., in terms of segmentation (Ma et al., 2007) or word order. 
Since many concepts are expressed by idiomatic multiword expressions instead of single words, and different languages may realize the same concept using different numbers of words (Ma et al., 2007; Wu, 1997), word alignment based methods, which are highly dependent on the probability information at the lexical level, are not well suited for this type of translation. 
(Ma et al., 2007) proposed an approach to improve word alignment by optimising the segmentation of both source and target languages. 
However, the differences in lexicalization may degrade word alignment performance, for different languages may realize the same concept using different numbers of words (Ma et al., 2007; Wu, 1997). 
The second measure is the alignment confidence (Ma et al., 2007), defined as AC(ai) = C(ai)COOC(C i,ei) , where C(ai) denotes the number of alignments proposed by the word aligner that are identical to ai.

been proposed, which involves the integration of QA systems with dialogue interfaces in order to encourage and accommodate the submission of multiple related questions and handle the users requests for clarification in a less artificial setting (Maybury, 2002); however, Interactive QA (IQA) systems are still at an early stage or applied to closed domains (Small et al., 2003; Kato et al., 2006). 
In many cases, they involve dealing with several events, or identifying and reasoning about certain relations among events which are only partially stated in the source documents (such as temporal and causal ones), all of which makes the pattern-based approach less suitable for the task (Small et al. , 2003, Soricut and Brill, 2004). 
To better facilitate user information needs, recent trends in QA research have shifted towards complex, context-based, and interactive question answering (Voorhees, 2001; Small et al. , 2003; Harabagiu et al. , 2005). 
However, except for a few systems that use dialog to address complex questions (Small et al. , 2003; Harabagiu et al. , 2005), the general dialog capabilities have been lacking in most ques This work was partially supported by IIS-0347548 from the National Science Foundation. 
Clarification dialogues can be applied to negotiate with users about the intent of their questions (Small et al. , 2003).

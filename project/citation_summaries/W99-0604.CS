4 Phrase-Based Translation In phrase-based translation, the translation process is modeled by splitting the source sentence into phrases (a contiguous string of words) and translating the phrases as a unit (Och et al., 1999; Koehn et al., 2003). 
Further details on the alignment template approach are described in (Och et al. , 1999; Och and Ney, 2002). 
The key elements of this translation approach (Och et al. , 1999) are the alignment templates. 
 improved word order  A significant source of errors in statistical machine translation is the word reordering problem (Och et al. , 1999). 
1 Introduction The Alignment Template Translation Model (ATTM) (Och et al. , 1999) has emerged as a promising modeling framework for statistical machine translation.

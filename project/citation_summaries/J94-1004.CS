As a consequence, only one adjunction can take place on an elementary node, as is prescribed by the tree adjoining grammar formalism (Schabes and Shieber, 1994). 
Furthermore, our new algorithm is related to many existing recognition algorithms for TAGs (Vijay-Shankar and Joshi 1985; Schabes and Joshi 1988; Lang 1988; Vijay-Shanker and Weir 1993; Schabes and Shieber 1994; Schabes 1994), some of which were published 356 Nederhof Correct-Prefix Property for TAGs together with proofs of correctness. 
We are 12 This term is from Schabes and Shieber (1994). 
Schabes and Shieber (1994), for instance, suggest allowing multiple adjunctions of modifier trees to the same node on tile grounds that selectional constraints hold between the modified node and each of its modifiers but, if only a single adjunction may occur at the modified node, only the first tree that is adjoined will actually be local to that node. 
However, they represent important linguistic intuition, they provide a uniform interface to semantics, and they are, as Schabes ~ Shieber (1994) argue, important in order to support statistical parameters in stochastic frameworks and appropriate adjunction constraints in TAG.

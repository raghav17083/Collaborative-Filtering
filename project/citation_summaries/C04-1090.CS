2 Related Work A number of researchers (Brown et al. , 1992; Berger et al. , 1996; Niessen and Ney, 2004; Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et al. , 2005) have described approaches that preprocess the source language input in SMT systems. 
With memoizationm, we get a dynamic programming algorithm that is guaranteed to run in O(n) time where n is the length of the input string, since the size of the parsetree is proportional to n. Similar algorithms have also been proposed for dependency-based translation (Lin, 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005). 
This information source is deployed in recent work either for pre-ordering source sentences before they are input to to a phrase-based system (Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et al. , 2005), or for re-ordering the output of translation models by statistical ordering models that access linguistic information on dependencies and part-of-speech (Lin, 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al. , 2005)1. 
In contrast to the work by Lin (2004) and by Quirk et al. 
1 Introduction Syntactic reordering approaches are an effective method for handling systematic differences in word order between source and target languages within the context of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems (Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et al. , 2005).

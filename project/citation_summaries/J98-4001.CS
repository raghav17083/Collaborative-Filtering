Karen Lochbaum (1998) A Collaborative Planning Model of Intentional Structure. 
Our model of dialog derives from rule-based theories of dialog structure, such as (Perrault and Allen, 1980; Grosz and Kraus, 1996; Lochbaum, 1998). 
To determine the principles governing human collaboration, we have relied on research in computational linguistics on collaborative discourse, specifically within the SharedPlan framework of Grosz and Sidner (1986, 1990) (Grosz and Kraus, 1996, Lochbaum, 1998). 
One intention is that discussed above, which is associated with analysis I.a. Another intention depends on unit Bz and the JUSTIFICATION relation that holds between units A1 and lh; this intention is associated with the analyses shown in ligure 1.c and l.e. And another intention depends on trait Bj and the JUSTIFICATION relation that holds between units l)j and Bj ; this intention is associated with the analyses shown in figure 1.b and 1.d. Reasoning fronl text structures to intentions can be also beneficial hi a context such as that described by Lochbaum (1998) because the rhetorical constraints can help prune the space of shared phms that woukl characterize an intEn tional interpretati o n of a d iscou rse. 
Conversely, dialog systems for troubleshooting in the literature have not attempted to model uncertainty directly (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Lochbaum, 1998).

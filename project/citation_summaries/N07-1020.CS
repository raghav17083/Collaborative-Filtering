A second example of subtle language dependence comes from Dasgupta and Ng (2007), who present an unsupervised morphological segmentation algorithm meant to be language-independent. 
In particular, we have implemented an unsupervised morphological analyzer that outperforms Goldsmith s (2001) Linguistica and Creutz and Lagus s (2005) Morfessor for our English and Bengali datasets and compares favorably to the bestperforming morphological parsers in MorphoChallenge 20053 (see Dasgupta and Ng (2007)). 
Allomorphs (e.g., deni and deny) are also automatically identified in (Dasgupta, 2007), but the general problem of recognizing highly irregular forms is examined more extensively in (Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000). 
Unsupervised approaches are attractive due to the the availability of large quantities of unlabeled text, and unsupervised morphological segmentation has been extensively studied for a number of languages (Brent et al., 1995; Goldsmith, 2001; Dasgupta and Ng, 2007; Creutz and Lagus, 2007). 
However, it seems unrealistic to expect a one-size-fits-all approach to be achieve uniformly high performance across varied languages, and, in fact, it doesnt. Though the system presented in (Dasgupta and Ng, 2007) outperforms the best systems in the 2006 PASCAL challenge for Turkish and Finnish, it still does significantly worse on these languages than English (F-scores of 66.2 and 66.5, compared to 79.4).

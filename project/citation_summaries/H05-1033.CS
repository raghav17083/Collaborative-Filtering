While Sporleder and Lapata (2005) demonstrated thattheirfinite-statesystemcouldperformaswellas the SPADE system, which uses context-free parse trees, this does not directly answer the question of the utility of context-free derived features for this task. 
Thus, in section 2.3, for comparison with reported results in Sporleder and Lapata (2005), ourF1-scoreisdefinedaccordingly, i.e.,segSegmentation system F1 Sporleder and Lapata best (reported) 88.40 SPADE Sporleder and Lapata configuration (reported): 87.06 current configuration: 91.04 Table 1: Segmentation results on the Sporleder and Lapata (2005)dataset, withaccuracydefinedtoincludesentenceinitial segmentation boundaries. 
Most of the current work on discourse processing focuses on sentence-level text organization (Soricut and Marcu, 2003) or the intermediate step (Sporleder and Lapata, 2005). 
This feature set is very close to that used in Sporleder and Lapata (2005), but not identical. 
Table 1 compares segmentation results of three systems on the Sporleder and Lapata (2005) 608 sentence subset of the evaluation data: (1) their best reported system; (2) the SPADE system results reported in that paper; and (3) the SPADE system results with our current configuration.

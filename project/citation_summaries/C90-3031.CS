have been used in statistical machine translation (Brown et al. , 1990), terminology research and translation aids (Isabelle, 1992; Ogden and Gonzales, 1993; van der Eijk, 1993), bilingual lexicography (Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990; Smadja, 1992), word-sense disambiguation (Brown et al. , 1991b; Gale et al. , 1992) and information retrieval in a multilingual environment (Landauer and Littman, 1990). 
A PROGRAM FOR ALIGNING SENTENCES IN BILINGUAL CORPORA William A. Gale Kenneth W. Church AT&T Bell Laboratories 600 Mountain Avenue Murray Hill, NJ, 07974 ABSTRACT Researchers in both machine Iranslation (e.g. , Brown et al. , 1990) and bilingual lexicography (e.g. , Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990) have recently become interested in studying parallel texts, texts such as the Canadian Hansards (parliamentary proceedings) which are available in multiple languages (French and English). 
Motivation There have been quite a number of recent papers on parallel text: Brown et al (1990, 1991, 1993), Chen (1993), Church (1993), Church et al (1993), Dagan et al (1993), Gale and Church (1991, 1993), Isabelle (1992), Kay and Rgsenschein (1993), Klavans and Tzoukermann (1990), Kupiec (1993), Matsumoto (1991), Ogden and Gonzales (1993), Shemtov (1993), Simard et al (1992), WarwickArmstrong and Russell (1990), Wu (to appear). 
machine translation (Brown et al. 1993) but also in other applications such as word sense disanabiguation (Brown et al. 1991) and bilingnal lexicography (Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990). 
Introduction Researchers in both machine lranslation (e.g. , Brown et al, 1990) and bilingual lexicography (e.g. , Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990) have recently become interested in studying bilingual corpora, bodies of text such as the Canadian I-lansards (parliamentary debates) which are available in multiple languages (such as French and English).

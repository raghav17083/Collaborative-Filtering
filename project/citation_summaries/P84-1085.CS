2 The Classical Linguistic Discourse Model (C-LDM) Unlike the Discourse Structures Model (DSM) of Grosz and Sidner (1986), a pragmatic and psychological theory that aims to clarify the relationship between speakers intentions and their focus of attention in discourse, or the rhetorical model of Rhetorical Structures Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988) that is designed to identify the coherence relations between segments of text, the Linguistic Discourse Model (LDM) (Polanyi and Scha, 1984; Polanyi, 1988; Polanyi and van den Berg, 1996) is a syntactically informed, semantically driven model developed to provide proper semantic interpretation for every utterance in a discourse despite the apparent discontinuities that are present even in well structured written texts. 
Caenepeel 1991, Polanyi and Scha 1984). 
When comb'med with the powerful discourse structural framework of the Linguistic Discourse Model (Polanyi (1985, 1986, 1988, 1996) Potanyi and Scha (1984), Scha and Polanyi (1988), Prfist, H. , tL Scha and M. tLvan den Berg, 1994; Po~u~, L. and M. H. van den Berg 1996; van den Berg, M. H. 1996b), we provide a uni6ed account of di~ourse anaphora resolution. 
Our central model of a discourse grammar is the Linguistic Discourse Model (LDM) most often associated with Scha, Polanyi, and their coworkers (Polanyi and Scha 1984, Scha and Polanyi 1988, Priist 1992, and most recently in Priist, Scha and van den Berg 1994). 
The system developed by Polanyi & Scha (1984) uses five different levels to hierarchically structure a dialogue and LOKI (Wachtel, 1986) uses four.

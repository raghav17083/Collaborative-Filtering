2 MaltParser MaltParser is a transition-based parsing system which was one of the top performing systems on multilingual dependency parsing in the CoNLL 2006 shared task (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2006) and the CoNLL shared task 2007 (Nivre et al., 2007; Hall et al., 2007). 
This type of scoring function is often referred to as a firstorder model.8 Several systems participating in this yearssharedtaskusedfirst-ordermodels(Schiehlen and Spranger, 2007; Nguyen et al. , 2007; Shimizu and Nakagawa, 2007; Hall et al. , 2007b). 
Another innovation was the use of k-best spanning tree algorithms for inference with a non-projective first-order model (Hall et al. , 2007b). 
We implement a left-to-right arc-eager parsing model in a way that the parser scan through an input sequence from left to right and the right dependents are attached to their heads as soon as possible (Hall et al., 2007). 
An existing method to combine multiple parsing algorithms is the ensemble approach (Sagae and Lavie, 2006a), which was reported to be useful in improving dependency parsing (Hall et al., 2007).

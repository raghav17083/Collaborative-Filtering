Wilson and Wiebe (2003) developed an annotation scheme for so-called subjective sentences (opinions and other private states) as part of a U.S. government-sponsored project (ARDA AQUAINT NRRC) in 2002.


We have surveyed many studies about opinion mining (Lee et al., 2008; Kim and Hovy, 2006; Wilson and Wiebe, 2003; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006).

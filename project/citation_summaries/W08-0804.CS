When we run our classifiers on resource-tight environments such as cell-phones, we can use a random feature mixing technique (Ganchev and Dredze, 2008) or a memory-efficient trie implementation based on a succinct data structure (Jacobson, 1989; Delpratt et al., 2006) to reduce required memory usage.

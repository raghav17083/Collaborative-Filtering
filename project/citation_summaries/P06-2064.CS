Other researchers (Pantel and Ravichandran 2004; Pantel and Pennacchiotti 2006; Pennacchiotti and Pantel 2006) use clustering techniques coupled with syntactic dependency features to identify IS-A relations in large text collections.Kim and Baldwin (2005) propose a general-purpose method that computes the lexical similarity of unseen nounnoun compounds with those found in training.More recently Kim and Baldwin (2006) developed an automatic method for interpreting nounnoun compounds based on a set of 20 semantic relations.The relations are detected based on a xed set of constructions involving the constituent nouns and a set of seed verbs denoting the semantic relation (e.g., to own denotes POSSESSION).Then all nounnoun instances 4 These results were obtained on AltaVista on a general and abstract set of eight prepositions (Lauer 1995) as semantic classication categories: of,for,with,in,on,at,about,andfrom. 
Kim and Baldwin (2006) characterized the semantic relationship in a noun-noun compound using the verbs connecting the two nouns by comparing them to predefined seed verbs. 
Paraphrasesofthiskind have been shown to be useful in applications such as machine translation (Nakov, 2008a) and as an intermediate step in inventory-based classification of abstract relations (Kim and Baldwin, 2006; Nakov and Hearst, 2008). 
(Kim and Baldwin, 2006) and (Turney, 2006) focus on the lexical similarity of unseen noun compounds with those found in training. 
(Kim and Baldwin, 2006) use a set of seed verbs to characterize the semantic relation between the constituent nouns and explores a parsed corpus to classify NCs.

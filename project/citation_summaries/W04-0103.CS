for different syllable structures are taken from (Choudhury et al. , 2004).


The value of fe1 is simply the length of the word, that is fe1(w) = |w| (3) Suppose ? = ?1?2?k is the usual syllabification of w, where the usual or optimal syllabification for Bengali is defined similar to that of Hindi as described in (Choudhury et al. , 2004).


As described in (Choudhury et al. , 2004), the PCs are defined at the level of syllable onsets and codas and therefore, syllabification is a preprocessing step before evaluation of Cp.


In fact, there are also computational models satisfactorily accounting for cases of vowel deletion (Choudhury et al. , 2004; Choudhury et al. , 2006b) and assimilation (Dras et al. , 2003).

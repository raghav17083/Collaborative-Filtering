OHara and Wiebe (2003) also make use of high level features, in their case the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) to classify prepositions. 
Some research has focused on the sense disambiguation of specific prepositions (e.g. , Alam, 2004), while other work has classified preposition tokens according to their semantic role (OHara and Wiebe, 2003). 
OHara and Wiebe (2003) explain how both inventories can be used for preposition disambiguation. 
We noted previously the somewhat special part that prepositions play in marking semantic relations, in some sense mediating the role assignment of a verb to an argument.The resources noted earlier differ in their treatment of prepositions.In VerbNet, for example, prepositions are listed explicitly as part of the syntactic context in which a role is assigned (e.g., Agent V Prep(for)Recipient ), but it is the NP object of the preposition that receives the semantic role.In FrameNet and PropBank, on the other hand, the full prepositional phrase is considered as the frame element (the constituent receiving the role).Clearly, further work needs to proceed on how to best capture the interaction between verbs and prepositions in SRL.This is especially complex given the high polysemy of prepositions, and work has proceeded on relating preposition disambiguation to role assignment (e.g., OHara and Wiebe 2003).

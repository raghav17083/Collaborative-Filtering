We compared our annotations with the annotations of Hsueh and Moore (2007b) for the 17 meetings of our sub-corpus. 
8Note that the task of detecting decision sub-dialogues is not directly addressed by (Hsueh and Moore, 2007b). 
(2007) and Hsueh and Moore (2007b): lexical unigrams and durational and locational features from the transcripts; prosodic features extracted from the audio files using Praat (Boersma, 2001); general DA tags and speaker information from the AMI annotations; and contextual features consisting of the same set of features from immediately preceding and following utterances. 
Using the AMI Meeting Corpus, Hsueh and Moore (2007b) attempt to identify the dialogue acts (DAs) in a meeting transcript that are decisionrelated.

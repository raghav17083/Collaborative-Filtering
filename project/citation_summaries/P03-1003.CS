Question answering (e.g., Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001; Echihabi and Marcu, 2003; Voorhees, 2004; Metzler and Croft, 2005) relates to question search. 
Echihabi and Marcu (2003) presented a noisychannel approach in which they adapted the IBM model 4 from statistical machine translation (Brown etal. 
In (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003) another form of combining strategies for advanced QA is proposed: (1) a knowledge-based Q/A implementation based on syntactic/semantic processing is combined using a maximum-entropy framework with (2) a statistical noisy-channel algorithm for Q/A and (3) a pattern-based approach that learn from Web data. 
Since then, they were found useful in many other NLP applications (e.g. , word sense tagging [Diab and Resnik 2002] and question answering [Echihabi and Marcu 2003]). 
For example, syntactic information has been deployed to reformulate questions (Hermjakob et al. , 2002) or to replace questions by syntactically similar ones (Lin and Pantel, 2001); lexical ontologies such as Wordnet1 have been used to find synonyms for question words (Burke et al. , 1997; Hovy et al. , 2000; Prager et al. , 2001; Harabagiu et al. , 2001), and statistical machine translation (SMT) models trained on question-answer pairs have been used to rank candidate answers according to their translation probabilities (Berger et al. , 2000; Echihabi and Marcu, 2003; Soricut and Brill, 2006).

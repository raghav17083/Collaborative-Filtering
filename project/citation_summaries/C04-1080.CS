Banko and Moore (2004) showed that unsupervised tagger accuracies on English degrade from 96% to 77% if the lexicon is not constrained such that only high frequency tags exist in the POS-set for each word. 
Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Tagging Since the work of Merialdo (1994), the HMM has been the model of choice for unsupervised tagging (Banko and Moore, 2004). 
As Banko and Moore (2004) discovered when 5Note that the POS tag information is not used in these experiments, except for by the C&C tagger. 
The first category (e.g., (Kupiec, 1992; Merialdo, 1994; Banko and Moore, 2004; Wang and Schuurmans, 2005)) assumes there is a lexicon that lists the allowable tags for each word in the text.

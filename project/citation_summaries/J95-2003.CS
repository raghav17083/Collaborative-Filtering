P04-1017:3	10:216	However, research in centering theory (Sidner, 1981; Grosz et al. , 1983; Grosz et al. , 1995; Tetreault, 2001) has revealed that the local focusing (or centering) also has a great efiect on the processing of pronominal expressions.
---------------------------------------------------
P97-1013:4	32:221	Such constructs can include tense 96 and aspect (Moens and Steedman, 1988; Webber, 1988; Lascarides and Asher, 1993), certain patterns of pronominalization and anaphoric usages (Sidner, 1981; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Sumita et al. , 1992; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1995),/t-clefts (Delin and Oberlander, 1992), and discourse markers or cue phrases (Ballard, Conrad, and Longacre, 1971; Halliday and Hasan, 1976; Van Dijk, 1979; Longacre, 1983; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Schiffrin, 1987; Cohen, 1987; Redeker, 1990; Sanders, Spooren, and Noordman, 1992; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Knott, 1995; Fraser, 1996; Moser and Moore, 1997).

W03-1205:5	18:217	2 How to ensure local cohesion In the previous section we already mentioned that we are trying to improve the automatic summaries by using the continuity principle defined in Centering Theory (CT) (Grosz et al. , 1995).
---------------------------------------------------
P98-1090:6	26:162	The component of the theory that deals with pronominal reference, centering theory (Grosz et al. , 1995), only accounts for cases in which the antecedent of a pronoun is introduced by the previous sentence; cases such as (1) have to be handled by different mechanisms.
---------------------------------------------------
P98-1090:7	30:162	First of all, G&S propose a distinction between two components of the attentional state: the GLOBAL FOCUS, structured as a stack of focus spaces and accessed to interpret definite descriptions; and the LOCAL FOCUS, consisting of the information preferentially used to interpret pronouns In addition, they adopt CENTERING THEORY (Grosz et al. , 1995) as a theory of the local focus.
---------------------------------------------------
W99-0104:8	43:264	Such computational methods were presented in (Grosz et al. , 1995) and (Webber, 1988).
---------------------------------------------------
P00-1051:9	15:134	2 FUNDAMENTALS OF CENTERING THEORY Centering theory (Grosz et al. , 1995; Walker et al. , 1998b) is an object-centered theory of text coherence: it attempts to characterize the texts that can be considered coherent on the basis of the way discourse entities are introduced and discussed.
---------------------------------------------------
P00-1051:10	28:134	As a result, centering theory is best viewed as a cluster of theories, each of which specifies the parameters in a different ways: e.g., ranking has been claimed to depend on grammatical function (Kameyama, 1985; Brennan et al. , 1987), on thematic roles (Cote, 1998), and on the discourse status of the CFs (Strube and Hahn, 1999); there are at least two definitions of what counts as previous utterance (Kameyama, 1998; Suri and McCoy, 1994); and realization can be interpreted either in a strict sense, i.e., by taking a CF to be realized in an utterance only if an NP in that utterance denotes that CF, or in a looser sense, by also counting a CF as realized if it is referred to indirectly by means of a bridging reference (Clark, 1977), i.e., an anaphoric expression that refers to an object which wasnt mentioned before but is somehow related to an object that already has, as in the vase the handle (see, e.g., the discussion in (Grosz et al. , 1995; Walker et al. , 1998b)).
---------------------------------------------------
P00-1051:11	4:134	1 MOTIVATION Centering Theory (Grosz et al. , 1995; Walker et al. , 1998b) is best characterized as a parametric theory: its key definitions and claims involve notions such as utterance, realization, and ranking which are not completely specified; their precise definition is left as a matter for empirical research, and may vary from language to language.
---------------------------------------------------
N07-1055:12	26:190	2 Naive Entity Grids Entity grids, first described in (Lapata and Barzilay, 2005), are designed to capture some ideas of Centering Theory (Grosz et al. , 1995), namely that adjacent utterances in a locally coherent discourses are likely to contain the same nouns, and that important nouns often appear in syntactically important roles such as subject or object.
---------------------------------------------------
J97-1005:13	72:736	Isard and Carletta (1995) presented 4 naive subjects and 1 expert coder with transcripts of task-oriented dialogues from the HCRC Map Task Corpus (Anderson et al. 1991).
---------------------------------------------------
P05-1018:14	27:224	2 Related Work Local coherence has been extensively studied within the modeling framework put forward by Centering Theory (Grosz et al. , 1995; Walker et al. , 1998; Strube and Hahn, 1999; Poesio et al. , 2004; Kibble and Power, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
P05-1018:15	7:224	Not surprisingly, a variety of coherence theories have been developed over the years (e.g. , Mann and Thomson, 1988; Grosz et al. 1995) and their principles have found application in many symbolic text generation systems (e.g. , Scott and de Souza, 1990; Kibble and Power, 2004).

P05-1018:16	13:224	This assumption is not arbitrary  some of these regularities have been recognized in Centering Theory (Grosz et al. , 1995) and other entity-based theories of discourse.

---------------------------------------------------
W99-0106:22	16:182	The fact that current anaphora resolution systems rely exclusively on the linear nature of texts in Order to determine the LPA of an anaphor seems odd, given that several studies have claimed that there is a strong relation between discourse structure and reference (Sidner, 1981; Gmsz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et aL, 1995; Fox, 1987; Vonk et al. , 1992; Azzam et al. , 1998; Hitzeman and P.oesio, 1998).
---------------------------------------------------
W99-0106:23	36:182	Linear-O models an approach that assumes that all anaphors can be resolved intra-uuit; Linear-I models an appreach that corresponds roughly to centering (Grosz et aL, 1995).
---------------------------------------------------
W00-1007:24	6:279	One of the most popular approaches to anaphora resolution is centering (Grosz et al. , 1995), henceforth GJW95, which accounts for the relation between the saliency of entities in discourse and the use of referring expressions, incorporating syntax, semantics and pragmatics.
---------------------------------------------------
P96-1057:25	3:106	1 Introduction The centering model (Grosz et al. , 1995) focuses on the resolution of inter-sentential anaphora.
---------------------------------------------------
P96-1057:26	90:106	4 Comparison to Related Work Crucial for the evaluation of the centering model (Grosz et al. , 1995) and its applicability to naturally occurring discourse is the lack of a specification conceming how to handle complex sentences and intrasentential anaphora.
---------------------------------------------------
P98-2241:27	5:97	1 1 Introduction The centering framework (Grosz et al. , 1995) is one of the most influential computational linguistics theories relating local focus to the form chosen for referring expressions.
---------------------------------------------------
P98-2241:28	14:97	2 The Centering model The centering framework (Grosz et al. , 1995) makes three main claims: 1) given an utterance Un, the * The authors would like to thank James Alien, Marflyn Walker, and the anonymous reviewers for many helpful comments on a preliminary draft of the paper.
---------------------------------------------------
P98-2241:29	32:97	Readers unfamiliar with the model are referred to (Grosz et al. , 1995) for more details.
---------------------------------------------------
E99-1049:30	3:61	(Fox, 1987; Grosz et al. , 1995)), event anaphora has been widely neglected.
---------------------------------------------------
J00-4003:31	362:766	By contrast, in the evaluation of the MUC coreference task, where all types of referring expressions are considered, the resulting co-reference chains are evaluated, rather than just the indicated antecedent (Vilain et al. 1995).
---------------------------------------------------
W96-0410:32	104:250	Second, entities differ in SALIENCE (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et al. , 1995).
---------------------------------------------------
W96-0410:33	153:250	Various efforts at using TAG for generation (McDonald and Pustejovsky, 1985; Joshi, 1987; Yang et al. , 1991; Nicolov et al. , 1995; Wahlster et al. , 1991) enjoy many of these advantages.
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1020:34	44:230	Most models attempting to capture local coherence between sentences were based on or inspired by centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995), which postulated strong links between the center of attention in comprehension of adjacent sentences and syntactic position and form of reference.
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1020:35	10:230	Linguists have also studied various aspects of text flow, with cohesion-building devices in English (Halliday and Hasan, 1976), rhetorical structure theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988) and centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995) among the most influential contributions.
---------------------------------------------------
C00-1031:36	20:182	The fact that current anaphora resolution systems rely exclusively on the linear nature of texts in order to determine the LPA of an anaphor seems odd, given flint several studies have claimed that there is a strong relation between discourse structure and reference (Sidner, 1981 ; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et al. , 1995; Fox, 1987; Vonk ct al. , 1992; Azzam el al. , 1998; Hitzcman and Pocsio, 1998).
---------------------------------------------------
C00-1031:37	41:182	Linear-0 models an approach that assumes that :tll anaphors can be resolved intra-unit; Linear1 models an approach that cor,'esponds roughly to centering (Grosz et al. , 1995).
---------------------------------------------------
W99-0110:38	50:143	The principle modifications are: (1) The construction rules for proper names and definite descriptions introduce entities into the discourse model as they do in Kamp and Reyle (1993), but the construction rule for pronouns interprets pronouns as referring directly to entities in the discourse model which is not how the rule works in Kamp and Reyle (1993); (2) Discourse entities in the model are ranked in terms of prominence (an idea that derives from the set of forward-looking centers in Centering Theory, Grosz, et al. 1995) which influences the way in which coreference is established.
---------------------------------------------------
W99-0110:39	119:143	The model that is developed Discourse Prominence Theory (DPT) -integrates and elaborates on three theoretical sources: Discourse Representation Theory (DRT, Kamp & Reyle, 1993), Centering Theory (Grosz, et al. 1995), and the Binding Theory (Chomsky, 1986).
---------------------------------------------------
P08-2011:40	18:98	Centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995) describes additional constraints about which entities in a discourse can be pronominalized: if there are pronouns in a segment, they must include the backwardlooking center.
---------------------------------------------------
A00-1017:41	136:165	5.2 Handling Centering Information The CGS Centering module reasons about the entities that will be referred to in each sentence and produces a representation which records the forward and backward-looking centers (Grosz et al. , 1995).
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1079:42	146:174	Heuristic CL RANK a rank of NP in forward looking-center list based on Centering Theory (Grosz et al. , 1995) CL ORDER a order of NP in forward looking-center list based on Centering Theory (Grosz et al. , 1995) NP and PRED stand for a bunsetsu-chunk of a candidate antecedent and a bunsetsu-chunk of a predicate which has a target zero-pronoun respectively.
---------------------------------------------------
W00-1402:43	59:192	Josh( et al. 1995).
---------------------------------------------------
C96-1084:44	21:189	The solution we propose is embedded within the centering model (Grosz et al. , 1995).
---------------------------------------------------
C96-1084:45	59:189	We therefore incorporate into our model criteria which relate to the fimctional information structure of utterances using the methodological framework of the well-known centering model (Grosz et al. , 1995).
---------------------------------------------------
P98-2204:46	7:254	My proposal is inspired by the centering model (Grosz et al. , 1983; 1995) and draws on the conclusions of Strube & Hahn's (1996) approach for the ranking of the forward-looking center list for German.
---------------------------------------------------
P98-2204:47	22:254	The model has been motivated with evidence from preferences for the antecedents of pronouns (Grosz et al. , 1983; 1995) and has been applied to pronoun resolution (Brennan et al.
---------------------------------------------------
H05-1031:48	24:186	For example, centering theory (Grosz et al. , 1995) deals predominantly with local salience (local attentional status), and the givenness hierarchy (information status) of Prince (1992) focuses on how a referent got in the discourse model (e.g. through a direct mention in the current discourse, through previous knowledge, or through inference), leading to distinctions such as discourseold, discourse-new, hearer-old, hearer-new, inferable and containing inferable.
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1103:49	19:178	Particularly, this paper focuses on the centering theory (Sidner,1981;Grosz et al.,1995; Tetreault,2001), which reveals the significant impact of the local focus on referring expressions in that the antecedent of a referring expression usually depends on the center of attention throughout the local discourse segment (Mitkov,1998).
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1103:50	149:178	Since pronouns preferentially occur in the subject position and tend to refer to the main subject (Ehrlich 1980; Brennan 1995; Walker et al. 1998; Cahn 1995; Gordon and Searce 1995; Kibble et al. 2001), this paper only applies semantic features related with the semantic role of ARG0/agent, which is closely related with the grammatical role of subject, with regard to various predicates in a sentence.
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1103:51	32:178	In the centering theory itself, since the original work of Sidner (1979) on immediate focusing of pronouns and the subsequent work of Joshi and Weinstein (1981) on centering and inferences, much research has been done, including centering and linguistic realizations (Cote 1993; Prince and Walker 1995), empirical and psycholinguistic evaluation of centering predictions (Gordon et al  1993,1995; Brennan 1995; Walker et al 1998; Kibble 2001), and the cross-linguistic work on centering (Ziv and Crosz1994).
---------------------------------------------------
D09-1103:52	112:178	Furthermore, for those pronouns with the same ranking level, they are ordered according to their surface positions in a left-toright order, motivated by previous research on the centering theory (Grosz et al. 1995).
---------------------------------------------------
P09-1073:53	9:214	However, such approaches tend to disregard theoretical findings from discourse theories, such as Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995).
---------------------------------------------------
P09-1073:54	43:214	Theory-oriented rule-based methods (Kameyama, 1986; Walker et al., 1994), for example, focus on the Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995) and are designed to collect the salient candidate antecedents in the forward-looking center (Cf ) list, and then choose the most salient candidate, Cp, as an antecedent of a zero-pronoun according to heuristic rules (e.g. topic > subject > indirect object > direct object > others 1 ).
---------------------------------------------------
P09-1073:55	16:214	On the other hand, rule-based methods derived from theoretical background such as Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995) only deal with the salient discourse entities at each point of the discourse status.
---------------------------------------------------
C96-1090:56	88:170	Note that we have derived an essence of centering theory (Joshi and Weinstein, 1981; Kamcyama, 1986; Walker et al. , 1994; Grosz et al. , 1995).
---------------------------------------------------
C96-1090:57	19:170	As an example, centering theory (Grosz et al. , 1995) could be attributed to game-theoretic accounts, as demonstrated l~ter in this paper.
---------------------------------------------------
C96-1060:58	31:250	b,,cause the el, or a segment initial utterance is left unspecified; in (21)) the Ct) is,lohn, as it is the only pronoun, and also the only entity t)elonging to the Cf list of (2@ a(Grosz et al. , 1986; Gro,'z ct al. , 1995) propose that (;tie ordo, ring on transi(;ions l)erl;~dns to sequences of transitions rather (;h3Jl to single transitions.
---------------------------------------------------
C96-1060:59	6:250	Some exceptions are (Samek-Lodovici and Strapparava, 1990), that discusses interpretation of referential expressions within dialogues to access a videodisc on Italimi art; (Not and Zancanaro, 1995), that adopts a systemic gra,nmar approadi (Halliday, 1976); and (Di Eugenio, 1990), which uses centering theory (Grosz et al. , 1995) to account for the alternation of null and strong subjects.
---------------------------------------------------
C96-1060:60	11:250	2 Centering theory Centering the.ory (Grosz et al. , 1986; Brennan ct al. , 1987; Grosz et al. , 1995) models local cohere.nee in discourse: it keet)s track of how local focus varies from one utterance to the next.
---------------------------------------------------
A00-2003:61	46:246	For pronoun generation, the original centering model (Grosz et al. , 1995) provides a rule which is supposed to decide whether a referring expression has to be realized as a pronoun.
---------------------------------------------------
A00-2003:62	43:246	There has been no comparison between corpusbased approaches for anaphora resolution and more traditional algorithms based on focusing (Sidner, 1983) or centering (Grosz et al. , 1995) except for Azzam et al.
---------------------------------------------------
W99-0207:63	127:148	Moreover, clues are used about the grammatical and pragmatic functions of expressions as in (Grosz et al. , 1995), (Strube, 1998), "or (Azzam et al. , 1998) as well as rule-based empirical approaches like (Nakaiwa and Shirai, 1996) or (Murata and Nagao, 1997), to determine the most salient referent.
---------------------------------------------------
P03-1069:64	113:237	Centering Theory (CT, Grosz et al. 1995) is an entity-based theory of local coherence, which claims that certain entities mentioned in an utterance are more central than others and that this property constrains a speakers use of certain referring expressions.
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1057:65	82:247	More recently, Clarke and Lapata (2007) use Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995) and Lexical Chains (Morris and Hirst, 1991) to identify which information to prune.
---------------------------------------------------
W04-0714:66	13:154	One method is to integrate different knowledge sources or factors (e.g. gender and number agreement, c-command constraints, semantic information) that discount unlikely candidates until a minimal set of plausible candidates is obtained (Grosz et al. , 1995; Lappin and Leass, 1994; Okumura and Tamura, 1996; Walker et al. , 1998; Yeh and Chen, 2001).
---------------------------------------------------
W04-0714:67	45:154	Psychological research and cross-linguistic research have validated that the C b is preferentially realized by a pronoun in English and by equivalent forms (i.e. zero anaphora) in other languages (Grosz et al, 1995).
---------------------------------------------------
W04-0714:68	33:154	In addition to the structures for centers, C b, and C f, the centering model specifies a set of constraints and rules (Grosz et al, 1995; Walker et al. 1994).
---------------------------------------------------
W04-0714:69	27:154	2 Centering Model In the centering theory (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et al, 1995; Walker et al. , 1994; Strube and Hahn, 1996), the 'attentional state' was identified as a basic component of discourse structure that consisted of two levels of focusing: global and local.
---------------------------------------------------
W04-0714:70	31:154	They are not constrained by features of any previous utterance in the discourse segment (DS), and the elements of C f (U n ) are partially ordered to reflect relative prominence in U n. Grosz et al. , in their paper (Grosz et al, 1995), assume that grammatical roles are the major determinant for ranking the forward-looking centers, with the order Subject > Object(s) > Others.
---------------------------------------------------
P97-1026:71	78:188	Second, entities differ in SALIENCE (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et al. , 1995).
---------------------------------------------------
P97-1026:72	133:188	As in centering (Grosz et al. , 1995), the subject is taken to be the most salient entity.
---------------------------------------------------
P97-1026:73	180:188	These aspects of TAGs are crucial to SPUD, as they are to (McDonald and Pustejovsky, 1985; Joshi, 1987; Yang et al. , 1991; Nicolov et al. , 1995; Wahlster et al. , 1991; Danlos, 1996).
---------------------------------------------------
C02-1078:74	15:152	In rule-based approaches (Grosz et al. , 1995; Hobbs, 1978; Mitkov et al. , 1998; Nakaiwa and Shirai, 1996; Okumura and Tamura, 1996; Palomar et al. , 2001; Walker et al. , 1994), anaphoric relations between anaphors and their antecedents are identified by way of handcrafted rules, which typically rely on syntactic structures, gender/number agreement, and selectional restrictions.
---------------------------------------------------
J04-3003:75	829:903	50 The version of Rule 2 from Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995), formulated in terms of sequences and stating a preference for sequences of CON over sequences of RET over sequences of SHIFT (which we tested by counting the number of sequence pairs), suffers from the problem that even with the best instantiations, fewer than one-third of sequence pairs involve the same transition, and even fewer are sequences of the transitions considered by Grosz et al. Even in the instantiation which yields the best results for Rule 2 (BFP), IS with STRUBE-HAHN ranking, only 13% of sequence pairs are of the form CON-CON/RET-RET/SH-SH, and altogether only 28% of sequence pairs involve only transitions considered by Grosz et al. Keeping in mind that Rule 2 (GJW 95) applies only to a minority of sequence pairs, we do find that with IS and STRUBE-HAHN ranking, the number of CON-CON sequences (37) slightly exceeds the number of RETRET (35), which in turn exceeds the number of SH-SH (19, of which 16 are RSH-RSH).
---------------------------------------------------
J04-3003:76	90:903	314 Computational Linguistics Volume 30, Number 3 2.3 Main Claims In the words of Grosz et al. , the most fundamental claim of centering is that to the extent that discourse adheres to centering constraints, its coherence will increase and the inference load placed upon the hearer will decrease (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995, page 210).
---------------------------------------------------
J04-3003:77	184:903	9 According to Walker, Joshi, and Prince (1998a), in the original version of Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995), which appeared in 1986, Grosz et al. provided a more explicit definition of realization: An utterance U realizes a center c if c is an element of the situation described by U, or c is the semantic interpretation of some subpart of U. With this definition, all of the cases considered abovethe anchors of associative references, traces, and the entities realized as firstand second-person pronounswould be considered as realized by an utterance.
---------------------------------------------------
I05-2030:78	73:148	Recent research advances have provided several important findings as follows:  Learning-based methods for antecedent identification can also benefit from the use of linguistic clues inspired by Centering Theory (Grosz et al. , 1995).
---------------------------------------------------
W97-0320:79	131:311	Although we found domain knowledge and taskspecific linguistic conventions most useful, we observed in the NMSU data some instances of potentially exploitable syntactic information to pursue in future work (Grosz et al. 1995, Sidner 1979).
---------------------------------------------------
W97-0320:80	17:311	The algorithm does not include a mechanism for handling global focus (Grosz & Sidner 1986), for centering within a discourse segment (Sidner 1979; Grosz et al. 1995), or for performing tense and aspect interpretation.
---------------------------------------------------
W99-0102:81	10:218	First, candidate referents can be ranked on the basis of accessibility (Erlm & Gundel 1987; Fretheim and Gundal 1996; C~mbacher and Hargreaves 1988, Grosz et al. 1995; Sidner 1983a, b; Walker et al. 1998).
---------------------------------------------------

P02-1012:94	28:175	Since discourse anaphora resolution was first studied theoretically (Grosz, 1977; Webber, 1979; Sidner, 1983; Grosz and Sidner, 1986), it has come to be dominated by Centering Theory (Grosz et al. , 1995; Di Eugenio, 1998; Walker, 1998) which proposes rules for the determination of focus and salience within a given segment of discourse.
---------------------------------------------------
P04-1019:95	60:183	However, the actual anchor, the cabinet, is clearly the Backward-Looking Center (CB) (Grosz et al. , 1995) of the first sentence after the title;5 and if we assume that entities can be indirectly realized see (Poesio et al. , 2004)the cabinet is the CB of all three sentences, including the one containing the BR, and therefore a preferred candidate.
---------------------------------------------------
P04-1019:96	68:183	Finally, Poesio examined the hypothesis that finding the anchor of a BD involves knowing which entities are the CB and the CP in the sense of Centering (Grosz et al. , 1995).

P04-1019:97	61:183	In (Poesio, 2003), the impact on associative BD resolution of both relatively simple salience features (such as distance and order or mention) and of more complex ones (such as whether the anchor was a CB or not) was studied using the GNOME corpus (discussed below) and the CB-tracking techniques developed to compare alternative ways of instantiating 5The CB is Centering theorys (Grosz et al. , 1995) implementation of the notion of topic or main entity.

---------------------------------------------------
H05-1028:99	39:180	Many theories on linguistic salience have been developed, including how the salience of entities affects the form of referring expressions as in the Givenness Hierarchy (Gundel et al. , 1993) and the local coherence of discourse as in the Centering Theory (Grosz et al. , 1995).

W99-0108:110	73:260	Centering's Rule 1 states that if any element of the previous utterance's forward looking center list is realized in the current utterance as a pronoun, then the backward looking center must be realized as a pronoun as well (Grosz et al. , 1995.
---------------------------------------------------
P98-2155:111	21:155	These interactions can be formally expressed in the framework of attentional modeling by the following principles of interpretation:  The LEXICAL FORM OF A REFERRING EXPRESSION indicates the level of attentional processing, i.e., pronouns involve local focusing while full lexical forms involve global focusing (Grosz et al. , 1995).
---------------------------------------------------
P98-2155:112	22:155	 The GRAMMATICAL FUNCTION of a referring expression reflects the local attentional status of the referent, i.e., subject position generally holds the highest ranking member of the forward-looking centers list (Cf list), while direct object holds the next highest ranking member of the Cf list (Grosz et al. , 1995; Kameyama, 1985).

P96-1036:135	222:252	5 Comparison with Related Approaches The centering model (Grosz et al. , 1983; 1995) is concerned with the interactions between the local coherence of discourse and the choices of referring expressions.
---------------------------------------------------
P96-1036:136	4:252	1 Introduction The centering model has evolved as a methodology for the description and explanation of the local coherence of discourse (Grosz et al. , 1983; 1995), with focus on pronominal and nominal anaphora.
---------------------------------------------------
P96-1036:137	156:252	While it is usually assumed that the elliptical expression ranks above its antecedent (Grosz et al. , 1995, p.217), we assume the contrary.

---------------------------------------------------
P96-1036:139	190:252	In particular, chains of the RETAIN transition in passages where the Cb does not change (passages with constant theme) show that the canonical ordering constraints for the forwardlooking centers are not appropriate, The numbers of centering transition pairs generated by the different approaches are shown in Table 10, In general, the functional approach shows the best re6As a consequence of this postulate, we have to redefine Rule 2 of the Centering Constraints (Grosz et al. , 1995, p.215) appropriately, which gives an informal characterization of a preference for sequences of CONTINUE over sequences of RETAIN arid, similarly, sequences of RETAIN over sequences of SHIFT.
---------------------------------------------------
P96-1036:140	66:252	3 Principles of Functional Centering Within the framework of the centering model (Grosz et al. , 1995), we distinguish each utterance's backward-looking center (Gb(U,~)) and its forwardlooking centers (G!

A00-3001:159	12:182	The task of text planning is to select the relevant information to be expressed in the text and organise it into a hierarchical structure which captures certain discourse preferences such as preferences for global coherence (e.g. the use of RST relations (Mann and Thompson, 1987)) and local coherence (e.g. center transitions as defined in Centering Theory (Grosz et al. , 1995)).
---------------------------------------------------
W04-0710:160	20:211	It has long been observed that a more accurate view is that REs rather specify representations of entities in the speakers or hearers mind, an abstraction called discourse entities or DEs (Sidner, 1983; Grosz et al. , 1995).

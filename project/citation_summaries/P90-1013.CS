Introduction The generation of referring expressions is one of the most common tasks in natural language generation and has been addressed by many researchers in the past two decades, including Appelt (1985), Reiter (1990), Dale and Haddock (1991), Dale (1992), Dale and Reiter (1995), Horacek (1997), Stone and Webber (1998), Krahmer and Theune (1998, 2002), Bateman (1999), and van Deemter (2000, 2002). 
Traditionally, these principles have been defined via an interpretation of the Gricean maxims (Dale, 1989; Reiter, 1990; Dale and Reiter, 1995; van Deemter, 2002)1.

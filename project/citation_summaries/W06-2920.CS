As evident from the CoNLL-X shared task on dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006), there are currently two dominant models for data-driven dependency parsing. 
CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006). 
We represent the data into a columns format, following the standard format of the CoNLL Shared Task 2006 (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006), in which sentences are separated by a blank line and fields are separated by a single tab character. 
Dependency treebanks are becoming available in many languages, and several approaches to dependency parsing on multiple languages have been evaluated in the CoNLL 2006 and 2007 shared tasks (Buchholz & Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al. , 2007).

We constructed a partially parallel corpus in the form of Pattern 1 from the union of the two corpora using the heuristic rules defined in (Lin et al., 2008). 
Similar with (Lin et al., 2008), we compare our final mined lexicon with a dictionary extracted from Wikipedia, the biggest multilingual free-content encyclopedia on the Web. 
The other is multilingual parallel and comparable corpora (e.g., Wikipedia1), wherein features such as cooccurrence frequency and context are popularly employed (Cheng et al., 2004; Shao and Ng, 2004; Cao et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2008).

The initial parenthetical translation corpus is constructed by applying the heuristic rules defined in (Lin et al., 2008)3.

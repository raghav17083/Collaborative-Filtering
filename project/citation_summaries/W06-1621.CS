We were mostly inspired by (Glickman et al., 2006), which coined the term lexical reference to denote concrete references in text to the specific meaning of a given term. 
A similar goal was addressed in (Glickman et al., 2006), who defined the notion of lexical reference to model the fact that in order to entail a hypothesis, the text has to entail each non-compositional lexical element within it. 
Aiming to capture such lexical inferences we followed (Glickman et al., 2006), which coined the term lexical reference (LR) to denote references in text to the specific meaning of a target term. 
Lexical Entailment, and in particular lexical reference (Glickman et al. , 2006b)1, is in turn a subtask of textual entailment, which is formally de ned as a relationship between a coherent text T and a language expression, the hypothesis H. T is said to entail H, denoted by T !H, if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T (Dagan et al. , 2005; Dagan and Glickman. 
In the literature, slight variations of this problem are also referred to as sense matching (Dagan et al. , 2006), lexical reference (Glickman et al. , 2006a) and lexical substitution (Glickman et al. , 2006b).

The pattern-concept pair representation falls into a class of linguistic representations known as feature systems, including lexical functional grammar (Bresnan 1982), functional grammar (Kay 1979) and functional unification grammar (Kay 1984). 
The unification used in this connection is based on the functional description unification described by Kay I1984/. 
The family of grammar models that are based on such formalisms include Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG) \[Gazdar et al. 1985\], Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) \[Bresnan 1982\], Functional Unification Grammar (bUG) \[Kay 1984\], Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (I-IPSG) \[Pollard and Sag 1988\], and Categorial Unification Grammar (CUG) \[Karttunen 1986, Uszkoreit 1986, Zeevat et al. 1987\]. 
More recently, a dictionary server, of the kind described by Kay (1984b), was implemented and installed as a background process on a Xerox workstation networked together with the rest of the equipment dedicated to natural language processing applications (Boguraev et al. , 1987). 
Recent developments in linguistics, and especially on grammatical theory -for example, Generalised Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar et al. , 1985), Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) -and on natural language parsing frameworks for example, Functional Unification Grammar (FUG) (Kay, 1984a), PATR-II (Shieber, 1984) -make it feasible to consider the implementation of efficient systems for the syntactic analysis of substantial fragments of natural language.

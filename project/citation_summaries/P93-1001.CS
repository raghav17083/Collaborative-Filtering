For example, sentence alignment of bilingual texts are performed just by measuring sentence lengths in words or in characters (Brown et al. , 1991; Gale and Church, 1993), or by statistically estimating word level correspondences (Chen, 1993; Kay and RSscheisen, 1993). 
Parallel bilingual corpora have been shown to provide a rich source of constraints for statistical analysis (Brown et al. 1990; Gale and Church 1991; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Church 1993; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Department of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong. 
3 Bilingual Task: An Application for Word Alignment 3.1 Sentence and word alignment Bilingual alignment methods (Warwick et al. , 1990; Brown et al. , 1991a; Brown et al. , 1993; Gale and Church, 1991b; Gale and Church, 1991a; Kay and Roscheisen, 1993; Simard et al. , 1992; Church, 1993; Kupiec, 1993a; Matsumoto et al. , 1993; Dagan et al. , 1993). 
Algorithms that map bitext correspondence at the phrase or sentences level are limited in their applicability to bitexts that have easily recognizable phrase or sentence boundaries, and Church (1993) reports that such bitexts are far more rare than one might expect.

SCISSOR explores incorporating semantic labels into Collins model in order to produce a complete SAPT which is then used to generate a formal MR. The systems introduced in (Miller et al. , 1996; Miller et al. , 2000) also integrate semantic labels into parsing; however, their SAPTs are used to pro15 duce a much simpler MR, i.e., a single semantic frame. 
In the domain of the Air Traveler Information System (Miller et al. , 1996) the authors apply statistical methods to compute the probability that a constituent can fill in a semantic slot within a semantic frame. 
Two more powerful modeling techniques for modeling clump generation are n-gram language models (Miller et al. , 1995; Levin and Pieraccini, 1995; Epstein, 1996), and headword language models (Epstein, 1996). 
Some of the previous work on semantic parsing has focused on fairly simple domains, primarily, ATIS (Air Travel Information Service) (Price, 1990)whosesemanticanalysisisequivalenttofilling a single semantic frame (Miller et al. , 1996; Popescu et al. , 2004). 
The only exceptions of which we are aware axe a statistical approach to mapping airline-information queries into SQL presented in (Miller et al. , 1996), a probabilistic decision-tree method for the same task described in (Kuhn and De Mori, 1995), and an approach using relational learning (a.k.a. inductive logic programming, ILP) to learn a logic-based semantic parser described in (Zelle and Mooney, 1996).

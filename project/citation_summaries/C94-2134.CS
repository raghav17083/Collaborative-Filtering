Toward these problems, there were several attempts developed for automatically learning grammars based on rule-based approach(Ootani and Nakagawa, 1995), corpus-based approach(Srill, 1992)(Mori and Nagao, 1995) or hybrid approach(Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994b)(Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994a).


In this framework, a whole grammar is not acquired from scratch(Mori and Nagao, 1995) or an initial grammar does not need to be assumed(Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994a).


This hypothesis generation is similar to one applied in (Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994a).


2.2 Hypothesis Filtering The greater number of the hypotheses generated by the algorithm are linguistically unnatural, because the algorithm does not embody any linguistic principle to judge the appropriateness of hypotheses, and therefore we introduced a set of criteria to filter out unnatural hypotheses (Kiyono and Tsujii, 1993; Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994).


We have already proposed a mechanism which acquires sublanguage-specific linguistic knowledge from parsing failures and which can be used as a tool for linguistic knowledge customization (Kiyono and Tsujii, 1993; Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994).

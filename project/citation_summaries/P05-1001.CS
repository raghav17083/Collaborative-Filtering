From Ando and Zhang (2005). 
This is lower than the best reported results for this data set, which is 89.3% (Ando and Zhang, 2005), using a large amount of unlabeled data. 
Similarly, (Ando, 2006) exploits data from related tasks, using all labeled examples irrespective of target words for learning each sense using the Alternating Structure Optimization (ASO) algorithm (Ando and Zhang, 2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b). 
Ando and Zhang (2005) reported a substantial performance improvement compared with state-of-the-art supervised learning results for syntactic chunking with the CoNLL00 shared task data (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) and NER with the CoNLL03 shared task data (Tjong Kim Sang and Meulder, 2003).

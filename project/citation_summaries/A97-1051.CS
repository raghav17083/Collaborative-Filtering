Several efforts, notably the Alembic workbench (Day et al. , 1997) and similar tools, have provided interfaces to aid annotators in the process. 
Soft decision-making is also useful when the system is one of the components in a larger decision-malting process, as is the case in speech recognition systems (Bald et al. , 1989), or in an ensemble system like AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire, 1997). 
It has been applied to a wide variety of tasks, including part of speech tagging (Roche and Schabes, 1995; Brill, 1995), noun phrase chvnklng (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1999), parsing (Brill, 1996; Vilain and Day, 1996), spelling correction (Mangu and Brill, 1997), prepositional phrase attachment (Brill and Resnik, 1994), dialog act tagging (Samuel et al. , 1998), segmentation and message understanding (Day et al. , 1997), often achieving stateof-the-art performance with a small and easilyunderstandable list of rules. 
Many provide graphical user interfaces (GUI) for manual annotation (e.g. General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) (Cunningham et al. , 1997) and the Alembic Workbench (Day et al. , 1997)) as well as NLP tools and resources that can be manipulated from the GUI. 
We developed MUP within the DIAG-NLP project (Di Eugenio et al. , 2002), which is grafting an NLG component onto a tutorial program written in the VIVIDS (Munro, 1994) and DIAG (Towne, 1997) ITS authoring environment.

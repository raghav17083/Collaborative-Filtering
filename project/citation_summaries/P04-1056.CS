7 Related Work Recent work looking to directly model non-local dependencies and do approximate inference are that of Bunescu and Mooney (2004), who use a Relational Markov Network (RMN) (Taskar et al. , 2002) to explicitly model long-distance dependencies, Sutton and McCallum (2004), who introduce skip-chain CRFs, which add additional non-local edges to the underlying CRF sequence model (which Bunescu and Mooney (2004) lack) and Finkel et al. 
(2003), Bunescu and Mooney (2004)) to extract role fillers for events. 
In contrast, the increases published by Bunescu and Mooney (2004) are relative to a baseline system which scores only 80.9% on the same task. 
Bunescu and Mooney (2004) define a Relational Markov Network (RMN) which explicitly models long-distance dependencies, and use it to represent relations between entities. 
More distantly related work for multi-field extraction suggests methods for combining information in graphical models across multiple extraction instances (Sutton et al. , 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2004) . 7 Conclusion This paper has presented new experimental methodologies and results for cross-document information fusion, focusing on the task of biographic fact extraction and has proposed a new method for crossfield bootstrapping.

Surprisingly, it has been claimed by Schabes and Waters (1995) that this property is problematic for the mildly contextsensitive languages represented by tree-adjoining grammars (TAGs): the best practical parsing algorithms for TAGs have time complexity Cg(n 6) (Vijay-Shankar and Joshi \[1985\]; see Satta \[1994\] and Rajasekaran and Yooseph \[1995\] for lower theoretical upper bounds), whereas the only published algorithm with the correct-prefix property--that by Schabes and Joshi (1988)--has complexity O(n9). 
2.2 PARSING LEXICALIZED TAGs An Earley-type parser for TAGs has been developed by Schabes and Joshi (1988). 
An Earley-type parsing algorithm has been given by Schabes and Joshi (1988). 
We do not discuss general issues in parsing TAGs, rather we give the appropriate modifications that are needed to the existing Earley-type parsing algorithm for TAGs due to Schabes and Joshi (1988). 
Our grammar has been implemented in an Earley-type parser as defined in /Schabes and Joshi 1988/, and uses a dictionary which comprises of more than 4000 lexical items, that are the most common for French.

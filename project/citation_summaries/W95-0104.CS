A number of feature-based methods have been proposed, including Bayesian classifiers (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1993), decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994), Bayesian hybrids (Golding, 1995), and, more recently, a method based on the Winnow multiplicative weight-updating algorithm (Golding and Roth, 1996). 
For CSSC, we tested our system on the identical data from the Brown corpus used by Golding (1995), Golding and Roth (1996) and Mangu and Brill (1997). 
This method has been described elsewhere (Golding, 1995) and so will only be briefly reviewed here; however, the version used here uses an improved smoothing technique, which is mentioned briefly below. 
A number of feature-based methods have been tried, including Bayesian classifiers (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1992; Golding, 1995), decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994), and knowledge-based approaches (McRoy, 1992).

This approach is generally associated with the use of either:  A phrasal lexicon such as in the generation systems ANA (Kukich 1983a), PI-IRF.D (Jacobs 1985) and PAULINE (Hovy 1988).

the following sentences taken from stock market reports (Kukich 1983b; Smadja 1991), the semantic unit expressing the time appears as a floating unit at different syntactic levels:  Stock prices got off to a strong start. 
They go on to argue that besides eliminating a great deal of unnecessary 'generation from first principles,' this approach complements their use of a phrasal lexicon (Kukich, 1983; Hovy, 1988) at the linguistic level.

 An intrasentential syntactic filter for ruling out anaphoric dependence of a pronoun on an NP on syntactic grounds (This filter is presented in Lappin and McCord 1990a).

 A morphological filter for ruling out anaphoric dependence of a pronoun on an NP due to non-agreement of person, number, or gender features  A procedure for identifying pleonastic (semantically empty) pronouns  An anaphor binding algorithm for identifying the possible antecedent binder of a lexical anaphor (reciprocal or reflexive pronoun) within the same sentence (This algorithm is presented in Lappin and McCord 1990b).

Alternatively, a syntactic filter is applied to the parse tree and any noun phrases for which coreference with the relative pronoun is syntactically legal (or, in some cases, illegal) are passed to a semantic component which determines the antecedent using inference or preference rules (see (Correa, 1988), (Hobbs, 1986), (Ingria, & Stallard, 1989), (Lappin, & McCord, 1990)).

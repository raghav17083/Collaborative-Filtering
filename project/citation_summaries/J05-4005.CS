Some machine learning algorithms also have been investigated in Chinese NER, including HMM (Yu et al. , 1998; Jing et al. , 2003), class-based language model (Gao et al. , 2005; Wu et al. , 2005), RRM (Guo et al. , 2005; Jing et al. , 2003), etc. However, when a machine learning-based NER system is directly employed in a new domain, its performance usually degrades. 
In these languages, word segmentation (Chen and Liu, 1992; Chen and Bai, 1998; Chen and Ma, 2002; Ma and Chen, 2003; Gao et al., 2005) is often carried out firstly to identify words before word alignment (Wu and Xia, 1994). 
Supervised learning methods can effectively solve NER problem by learning a model from manually labeled data (Borthwick, 1999; Sang and Meulder, 2003; Gao et al., 2005; Florian et al., 2003). 
Unlike English, Chinese word segmentation is a very challenging problem because of the difficulties in defining what constitutes a word (Gao et al., 2005). 
Standard Chinese family names are generally single characters drawn from a set of 437 family names (there are also 9 two-character family names, although they are quite infrequent) and given names can be one or two characters (Gao et al. , 2005).

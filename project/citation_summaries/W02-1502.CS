The SRG is implemented within the Linguistic Knowledge Building (LKB) system (Copestake, 2002), based on the basic components of the grammar Matrix, an open?source starter-kit for the development of HPSG grammars developed as part of the LinGO consortium?s multilingual grammar engineering (Bender et al. , 2002). 
Examples include DELPH-IN grammars such as the English Resource Grammar (Flickinger, 2002; Uszkoreit, 2002), the various PARGRAM grammars (Butt et al. , 1999), and the Edinburgh CCG parser (Bos et al. , 2004). 
4 Desiderata To better understand the needs of grammar developers we carefully explored two existing grammars: the LINGO grammar matrix (Bender et al. , 2002), which is a basis grammar for the rapid development of cross-linguistically consistent gram146 mars; and a grammar of a fragment of Modern Hebrew, focusing on inverted constructions (Melnik, 2006). 
In this research, we focus particularly on the Grammar Matrix-based DELPH-IN family of grammars (Bender et al. , 2002), which includes grammars of English, Japanese, Norwegian, Modern Greek, Portuguese and Korean. 
In particular, we consider the LinGO Grammar Matrix (Bender et al. , 2002; Bender and Flickinger, 2005).

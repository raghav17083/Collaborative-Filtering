Sentence-level combination methods directly select hypotheses from original outputs of single SMT systems (Sim et al., 2007; Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008), while phrase-level or wordlevel combination methods are more complicated and could produce new translations different from any translations in the input (Bangalore et al., 2001; Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Matusov et al., 2006; Sim et al., 2007). 
Jayaraman and Lavie (2005) proposed a heuristic-based matching algorithm which allows nonmonotonic alignments to align the words between the hypotheses. 
Approaches to combination generally either select one of the hypotheses produced by the different systems combined (Nomoto, 2004; Paul et al. , 2005; Lee, 2005) or combine lattices/n-best lists from the different systems with different degrees of synthesis or mixing (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994; Bangalore et al. , 2001; Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Matusov et al. , 2006). 
(2008) proposed an incremental alignment method, and a heuristic-based matching algorithm was proposed by Jayaraman and Lavie (2005). 
(Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005) proposed another black-box system combination strategy.

A00-2012:1	66:180	E.g., From the underlying root \[hayib\]: haaba 'he feared' and yahaabu 'he fears' Stem allomorphs : Perfect: -biband-haabImperfect: -haband-haabIn the relevant literature (e.g. , Beesley, 1998; Kiraz, 1994), verbs belonging to the above classes are all assumed to have the pattern CVCVC.

W05-0701:2	32:207	The attempts to model Arabic morphology in a two-level system (Kays (1987) Finite State Model, Beesleys (1990; 1998) Two-Level Model and Kirazs (1994) Multi-tape Two-Level Model) reflect McCarthys separation of levels.
---------------------------------------------------
W05-0701:3	192:207	6 Related work The application of machine learning methods to Arabic morphology and PoS tagging appears to be somewhat limited and recent, compared to the vast descriptive and rule-based literature particularly on morphology (Kay, 1987; Beesley, 1990; Kiraz, 1994; Beesley, 1998; Cavalli-Sfora et al. , 2000; Soudi, 2002).
---------------------------------------------------
W09-0803:4	91:126	To give an overview of some of the subsequent constraints that are still necessary, we include here a few descriptions and examples (where the starred (***) tape snippets exemplify illegal configurations):  Every root consonant has a matching consonant on the input tape T1 k a t a b a T2 k t b T1 k a t a b a T2*** d r s  A vowel in the input which is matched by a V in the pattern, must have a corresponding vocalization vowel T1 k a t a b a T4 C V C V C T7 a a T1 k a t a b a T4 C V C V C T7*** u i  A position where there is a symbol in the input either has a symbol in the pattern tape or a symbol in the affix tape (but not both) T1 k a t a b a T4 C V C V C T5 a T1 k a t a b a T4 C V C V C T5*** 7The idea to preserve the gemination in the grammar is similar to the solutions regarding gemination and spreading of Forms II, V, and IX documented in Beesley (1998b) and Habash and Rambow (2006).
---------------------------------------------------
W98-1007:5	75:128	Consonant spreading, as in Form IX and Form XII, and biliteral roots also use the morphophonemic X symbol (Beesley, 1998c).
---------------------------------------------------
W98-1007:6	77:128	2 If patterns are allowed to contain non-radical consonants, as in the analyses of Harris (1941) and Hudson (1986), then the definitions must be complicated slightly to prevent radicals from intersecting with the nonradical consonants (Beesley, 1998b).
---------------------------------------------------
W98-1007:7	61:128	There are several variations of this method that produce the same effect (Beesley, 1998d), with different penalties in the size of the resulting transducer or in the performance; but in the end the constraint of discontiguous dependencies is easily accomplished using finite-state techniques.
---------------------------------------------------
W98-1007:8	73:128	Other vocalizations are defined similarly: 53 define PerfActive \[a*\]/\V ; define PerfPassive \[u* i\]/\V ; define ImperfPassive \[u a*\]/\V ; Given the definitions above, xfst will evaluate the expressions on the left below, indicating the intersection of a root, a pattern and a vocalization, and return a language consisting of the single string on the right, an interdigitated but still morphophonemic stem (Beesley, 1998a).

The two types of approach that have been developed for text generation are (i) McKeown's Rhetorical Schemas (McKeown, 1982; Paris & McKeown, 1987) (ii) and, within the Penman project, Rhetorical Structure Theory (see e.g., Mann & Thompson, 1987; Matthiessen & Thompson, 1988; Mann, Matthiessen & Thompson, 1989).


I will discuss one example of the decoding approach in more detail in Section 3, chooser & inquiry semantics developed for and used in the Penman text generation system (e.g. , Mann, 1982; Matthiessen, 1988), and one example of the encoding approach in Section 4, the theory of situation-specific semantic systems (Halliday, 1973) modelled in Patten's (1988) SLANG generator.


However, a chooser may consist of more than one inquiry; if there is more than one, they are organized into a decision tree -an Inquiry tree (for examples, see Mann, 1982; Matthiessen, 1983; 1988).


3.2 The semantic control of a system: choosers and inquiries Now, we can organize a semantic interface in terms of the system network, which is what Bill Mann and I did in the development of the chooser and inquiry framework for one particular systemic generation grammar, the Nigel grammar developed at USC/ Information Sciences Institute (Matthiessen, 1981; Mann, 1982; Matthiessen, 1988); this framework was then adopted and extended for the systemic generator of Japanese and Chinese by John Bateman and associates at Kyoto University (Bateman & Matthiessen, forthcoming).

Chen and Ma (2002) proposed a practical unknown word extraction system by considering both morphological and statistical rule sets for word segmentation. 
Conventionally, there are four approaches to develop a CWS: (1) Dictionary-based approach (Cheng et al. 1999), especial forward and backward maximum matching (Wong and Chan, 1996); (2) Linguistic approach based on syntax-semantic knowledge (Chen et al. 2002); (3) Statistical approach based on statistical language model (SLM) (Sproat and Shih, 1990; Teahan et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2003); and (4) Hybrid approach trying to combine the benefits of dictionary-based, linguistic and statistical approaches (Tsai et al. 2003; Ma and Chen, 2003). 
Chen & Ma (2002) adopt another strategy: After an initial segmentation process, each monosyllable is decided whether it is a common word or a morpheme of unknown word by a set of syntactic discriminators.

In these languages, word segmentation (Chen and Liu, 1992; Chen and Bai, 1998; Chen and Ma, 2002; Ma and Chen, 2003; Gao et al., 2005) is often carried out firstly to identify words before word alignment (Wu and Xia, 1994).

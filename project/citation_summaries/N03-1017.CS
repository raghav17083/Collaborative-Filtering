3 System Overview 3.1 Translation model The system developed for this years shared task is a state-of-the-art, two-pass phrase-based statistical machine translation system based on a log-linear translation model (Koehn et al, 2003). 
The phrase-based decoder extracts phrases from the word alignments produced by GIZA++, and computes translation probabilities based on the frequency of one phrase being aligned with another (Koehn et al. , 2003). 
The production weights are estimated either by heuristic counting (Koehn et al., 2003) or using the EM algorithm. 
3.1 Phrase-Based Models According to the translation model presented in (Koehn et al. , 2003), given a source sentence f, the best target translation can be obtained using the following model best e 288 )( )()(maxarg )(maxarg | | e e e eef fee length LM best pp p = = (1) Where the translation model can be decomposed into )( | efp  =  = I i i iii i i II aefpbadef efp 1 1 1 1 ),|()()|( )|(   w (2) Where )|( i i ef is the phrase translation probability. 
To generate phrase pairs from a parallel corpus, we use the "diag-and" phrase induction algorithm described in (Koehn et al, 2003), with symmetrized word alignments generated using IBM model 2 (Brown et al, 1993).

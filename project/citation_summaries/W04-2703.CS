Discourse Treebank: The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Miltsakaki et al 2004a/b) is based on the idea that discourse connectives are predicates with associated argument structure (for details see (Miltsakaki et al 2004a, Miltsakaki et al 2004b). 
This paper describes an extended annotation scheme for marking the attribution of discourse relations and their arguments annotated in the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) (Miltsakaki et al. , 2004; Prasad et al. , 2004; Webber et al. , 2005), the primary goal being to capture the source and degrees of factuality of abstract objects. 
Assessment of inter-annotator agreement groups these annotations into five coarse classes (Miltsakaki et al. , 2004). 
Annotation of the remaining (unsignalled) relations between larger segments Step 1 is inspired by work done for English in the Penn Discourse TreeBank2 (Miltsakaki et al. , 2004). 
The Penn Discourse Treebank (Miltsakaki et al 2004a/b) treats discourse connectives as predicates and the sentences being joined as arguments.

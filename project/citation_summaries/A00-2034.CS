4.2 Verb Selection We evaluate our method on the causative alternation in order for comparison to the earlier method of McCarthy (2000). 
This means that the kind of straightforward propagation method used by McCarthy (2000) is not applicable to selectional profiles of this type. 
In McCarthy (2000), an error analysis reveals that the best method has more false positives than false negativessome slots are considered overly similar because the selectional profiles are compared at a coarsegrained level, losing fine semantic distinctions. 
Related Work Levins (1993) seminal study on diathesis alternations and verb semantic classes has recently influenced work in dictionary creation (Dorr 1997; Dang et al. 1998; Dorr and Jones 1996) and notably lexicon acquisition on the basis of the assumption that verbal meaning can be gleaned from corpora using cues pertaining to syntactic structure (Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Schulte im Walde 2000; Lapata 1999; McCarthy 2000). 
The two profiles become: a22a24a23a28a25a28a27a50a29a32a31a4a33a51a34a52a36 a38a44a42a19a38a40a39 a41a44a42a19a38a44a39 a45a44a42a14a38a40a42a6a38a44a42a19a38a40a42a6a38a44a42a19a38a40a39 a45a44a42a19a38a44a39a54a53a4a47 a22a24a23a28a25a28a27a50a29a32a31 a48 a34a52a36 a38a44a42a19a38a40a42a19a38a44a42a6a38a40a39 a46a40a42a19a38a44a39 a46a40a42a14a38a40a39 a45a44a42a19a38a44a39 a45a44a42a19a38a40a42a19a38a20a47 In the first method (that of McCarthy, 2000), the two profiles become identical.

In contrast, the named entity task, which identifies nouns and noun phrases, has generated numerous projects as evidenced by a host of papers in recent conferences, (e.g. Wacholder et al. 1997, Pahner and Day 1997, Neumann et al. 1997). 
The NPs are further processed by a namedentity recognizer (Prager et al. , 2000; Wacholder et al. , 1997), with reference to domain-specific proper names in our ontology. 
Name recognition is made harder in the closed caption domain by the fact that no capitalization information is given, thus making unusable all methods that rely on capitalization as the main way to identify candidates (Wolinski et al. , 1995) (Wacholder et al. , 1997). 
This so-called named entity recognition task has received considerable attention recently (Mani and MacMillan 1996; McDonald 1996; Paik et al. 1996; Bikel et al. 1997; Palmer and Day 1997; Wacholder and Ravin 1997; Mikheev, Moens, and Grover 1999) and was one of the tasks evaluated in the Sixth and Seventh Message Understanding Conferences. 
We are currently in the process of refining the head clustering procedure to handle organizations and other categories of proper names that have different naming conventions (Wacholder et al. 1997).

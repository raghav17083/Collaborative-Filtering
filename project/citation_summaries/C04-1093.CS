Such resources include WordNet (Prager et al., 2001) for  nding the genus of the question concept; large dictionaries such as Merriam Webster, for ready-to-use de nitions (Xu et al., 2004; Hildebrandt et al., 2004); and encyclopedias, for collecting words that are likely to occur in potential de nitions (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2004; Xu et al., 2004). 
Many of the proposed approaches, however, rely on manually crafted patterns or heuristics to identify definitions, and do not employ learning algorithms (Liu et al. , 2003; Fujii and Ishikawa, 2004; Hildebrandt et al. , 2004; Xu et al. , 2004). 
To this effect, the use of hand-written lexico-syntactic patterns and regular expressions, targeting the genus and possibly the differentia of the question concept, is widespread, whether employed for mining de nitions in English (Liu et al., 2003; Hildebrandt et al., 2004) or other languages such as Japanese (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2004), from local text collections (Xu et al., 2004) or from the Web (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2004; Androutsopoulos and Galanis, 2005). 
Commonly, such templates are specified manually and are hard-coded for a particular domain (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2004; Weischedel et al., 2004). 
Fujii and Ishikawa (2004) have shown how it is possible to identify de nitions semi automatically, however these sources are not as standard as dictionaries and thus harder to parse using only regular expressions.

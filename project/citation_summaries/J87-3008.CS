INTRODUCTION lately, a proliferation of computational lexicon environments (CLE) has been noticed, which sign i ftcantly influence the work on natural language (mainly, machine translation) (Byrd et al. 1987), (Nircnburg and Raskin 1987), (Ritchie et al. 1987) etc. With more and more computing power incorporated, the modern CLEs are capable to process not only individual inflected words or derivatives but also idioms and collocations. 
Koskenniemi(1985) refined the notation and sketched a compilation method, and Ritchie, Black et a1.(1987), Karttunen et al.(1987) describe compilation techniques for two variants of the notation. 
This requirement places a greater load on the grammar writer and is inconsistent with most recent unification-based grammar formalisms, which represent grammatical categories entirely as feature bundles (e.g. Gazdar et al. 1985; Pollard and Sag 1987; Zeevat, Calder, and Klein 1987). 
44 Graeme Ritchie Languages Generated by Two-Level Morphological Rules In the following illustrative example of a two-level morphological rule (taken from Ritchie et al. 1987), angle brackets indicate sequences of pairs and braces indicate alternatives; also, C, V, C2, and = represent subsets of the relevant symbol alphabets and + is an abstract symbol occurring in certain lexical forms.

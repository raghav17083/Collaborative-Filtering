For example, this method has been used to identify features for predicting accent assignment in text-tospeech (Hirschberg 1993), for repairing disfluencies (Nakatani and Hirschberg 1993), cue vs. noncue uses of discourse cue words (Litman 1996; Siegel and McKeown 1994), discourse segment boundaries (Grosz and Hirschberg 1992; Passonneau and Litman, this volume), intonational phrase boundaries (Wang and Hirschberg 1992), and the Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 1 most likely antecedents for anaphors (Aone and Bennet 1995; Connolly, Burger, and Day 1994). 
Lastly, Nakatani and Hirschberg (1993) also used the ATIS corpus, but in this case, focused only on detection, but detection of all three types of repairs. 
Nakatani and Hirschberg, 1993). 
Nakatani and Hirschberg (1993) investigated using acoustic informarion to detect the interruption point of speech repairs. 
(Subjects pressed a button to begin speaking to the system) (Nakatani and Hirschberg 1993) proposed a speech-first method in which prosodic cues are used mainly.

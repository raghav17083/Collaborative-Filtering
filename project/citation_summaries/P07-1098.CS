Resolving surface divergence of texts (e.g., voice of verbs and nominalizations) into unified semantic representations, SRL has attracted much attention from researchers into various NLP applications including question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004; Shen and Lapata, 2007; buy.v PropBank FrameNet Frame buy.01 Commerce buy Roles ARG0: buyer Buyer ARG1: thing bought Goods ARG2: seller Seller ARG3: paid Money ARG4: benefactive Recipient   Figure 1: A comparison of frames for buy.v defined in PropBank and FrameNet Moschitti et al., 2007), and information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003). 
representations: (1) linear kernels on the bag-of-words (BOW) or bag-of-POS-tags (POS) features, (2) the String Kernel (SK) (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004) on word sequences (WSK) and POStag sequences (POSSK), (3) the Syntactic Tree Kernel (STK) (Collins and Duffy, 2002) on syntactic parse trees (PTs), (4) the Shallow Semantic Tree Kernel (SSTK) (Moschitti et al., 2007) and the Partial Tree Kernel (PTK) (Moschitti, 2006) on PASs. 
Shallow semantic representations, bearing a more compact information, could prevent the sparseness of deep structural approaches and the weakness of BOW models (Moschitti et al., 2007). 
There is a widely held belief in the NLP and computational linguistics communities that identifying and defining roles of predicate arguments in a sentence has a lot of potential for and is a significant step toward improving important applications such as document retrieval, machine translation, question answering and information extraction (Moschitti et al., 2007). 
To overcome this problem, a Shallow Semantic Tree Kernel (SSTK) was designed in (Moschitti et al., 2007).

(2005) and Menezes and Richardson (2001) with respect to ordering models is difficult because they differ from each other in their statistical and dependency-tree alignment models. 
For example, such schema can serve as a mean to represent translation examples, or find structural correspondences for the purpose of transfer grammar learning (Menezes & Richardson, 2001), (Aramaki et al. , 2001), (Watanabe et al. , 2000), (Meyers et al. , 2000), (Matsumoto et al. , 1993), (kaji et al. , 1992), and example-base machine translation EBMT 3 (Sato & Nagao, 1990), (Sato, 1991), (Richardson et al. , 2001), (Al-Adhaileh & Tang, 1999). 
Besides being used in SMT, it is also used in translation lexicon building (Melamed 1996), transfer rule learning (Menezes and Richardson 2001), example-based machine translation (Somers 1999), etc. In previous alignment methods, some researches modeled the alignments as hidden parameters in a statistical translation model (Brown et al. 1993; Och and Ney 2000) or directly modeled them given the sentence pairs (Cherry and Lin 2003). 
For example, alignments can be used to learn translation lexicons (Melamed, 1996), transfer rules (Carbonell et al. , 2002; Menezes and Richardson, 2001), and classifiers to find safe sentence segmentation points (Berger et al. , 1996). 
Menezes & Richardson (2001) provides further details and an evaluation of the LF alignment algorithm.

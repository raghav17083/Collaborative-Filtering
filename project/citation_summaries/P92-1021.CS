Once the root spelling patterns and the affix combinations pointing to them have been created, analysis essentially reduces to an instance of affixstripping, which would be amenable to exactly the technique outlined by Carter (1992).


The interaction of morphological analysis with spelling correction (Carter, 1992; Oflazer, 1994; Bowden, 1995) is another possibly fruitful area of work.

One of the steps in the analysis of English is named entity recognition using Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005). 
Most previous work with CRFs containing nonlocal dependencies used approximate probabilistic inference techniques, including TRP (Sutton and McCallum, 2004) and Gibbs sampling (Finkel et al. , 2005). 
NER proves to be a knowledgeintensive task, and it was reassuring to observe that System Resources Used F1 + LBJ-NER Wikipedia, Nonlocal Features, Word-class Model 90.80 (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008) Semi-supervised on 1Gword unlabeled data 89.92 (Ando and Zhang, 2005) Semi-supervised on 27Mword unlabeled data 89.31 (Kazama and Torisawa, 2007a) Wikipedia 88.02 (Krishnan and Manning, 2006) Non-local Features 87.24 (Kazama and Torisawa, 2007b) Non-local Features 87.17 + (Finkel et al., 2005) Non-local Features 86.86 Table 7: Results for CoNLL03 data reported in the literature. 
We perform named entity tagging using the Stanford four-class named entity tagger (Finkel et al., 2005). 
Additionally, our approach makes it possible to do inference in just about twice the inference time with a single sequential CRF; in contrast, approaches like Gibbs Sampling that model the dependencies directly can increase inference time by a factor of 30 (Finkel et al. , 2005).

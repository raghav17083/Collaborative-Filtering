This step is analogous to the rule extraction as described in (Chiang, 2005). 
1 Introduction In statistical machine translation (SMT) community, the state-of-the-art method is to use rules that contain hierarchical structures to model translation, such as the hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005). 
Variations of SCFGs go back to Aho and Ullman (1972)s Syntax-Directed Translation Schemata, but also include the Inversion Transduction Grammars in Wu (1997), which restrict grammar rules to be binary, the synchronous grammars in Chiang (2005), which use only a single nonterminal symbol, and the Multitext Grammars in Melamed (2003), which allow independent rewriting, as well as other tree-based models such as Yamada and Knight (2001) and Galley et al. 
220 (Koehn et al., 2003); they can overlap.5 Additionally, since phrase features can be any function of words and alignments, we permit features that consider phrase pairs in which a target word outside the target phrase aligns to a source word inside the source phrase, as well as phrase pairs with gaps (Chiang, 2005; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007). 
From this point, our decoder is similar to the work by Chiang (2005).

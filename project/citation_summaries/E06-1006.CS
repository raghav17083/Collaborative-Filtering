D07-1091:1	21:185	Our framework is more general and goes beyond recent work on models that back off to representations with richer statistics (Nieen and Ney, 2001; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006; Talbot and Osborne, 2006) by keeping a more complex representation throughout the translation process.
---------------------------------------------------
W07-0729:2	63:159	A ?backoff??set, corresponding approximately to the method of Yang and Kirchhoff (2006) was generated by lemmatizing only unknown words.
---------------------------------------------------
W07-0729:3	13:159	To avoid this pitfall, Talbot and Osborne (2006) use a datadriven approach to cluster source-language morphological variants that are meaningless in the target language, and Yang and Kirchhoff (2006) propose the use of a backoff model that uses morphologically reduced forms only when the translation of the surface form is unavailable.
---------------------------------------------------
W07-0729:4	78:159	The backoff model, a slightly modified version of the method proposed by Yang and Kirchhoff (2006),1 does significantly better than the baseline (p <.05).
---------------------------------------------------

N09-1046:6	7:154	This problem has been widely acknowledged, and the conventional solution, which has been shown to work well for many language pairs, is to segment compounds into their constituent morphemes using either morphological analyzers or empirical methods and then to translate from or to this segmented variant (Koehn et al., 2008; Dyer et al., 2008; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006).
---------------------------------------------------
N09-1046:7	128:154	For all language pairs, we see significant improvements in both BLEU and TER when segmentation lattices are used.5 Additionally, we also confirmed previous findings that showed that when a large amount of training data is available, moving to a one-best segmentation does not yield substantial improvements (Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006).
---------------------------------------------------
N09-1046:8	136:154	6 Related work Aside from improving the vocabulary coverage of machine translation systems (Koehn et al., 2008; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006; Habash and Sadat, 2006), compound word segmentation (also referred to as decompounding) has been shown to be helpful in a variety of NLP tasks including monoand 6We note that our maximum entropy segmentation model could easily address this problem by incorporating information about whether a word is likely to be a named entity as a feature.
---------------------------------------------------
P09-1089:9	57:234	For translation from highly inflected languages, certain approaches rely on some form of lexical approximation or morphological analysis (Koehn and Knight, 2003; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006; Langlais and Patry, 2007; Arora et al., 2008).
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1122:10	135:211	Here we consider a simple interpolation scheme; they could also be used within a backoff model (Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006).
---------------------------------------------------
I08-1030:11	20:242	Unlike other languages (Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006; Nielen and Ney, 2000; Goldwater and McClosky, 2005), Chinese UNK translation cannot use information from stem and inflection analysis.
---------------------------------------------------
I08-1030:12	228:242	Using unknown word modeling such as backoff models was proposed by (Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006).
---------------------------------------------------
P08-2015:13	19:126	Some previous approaches anticipate OOV words that are potentially morphologically related to in-vocabulary (INV) words (Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006).
---------------------------------------------------
W07-0735:14	147:302	Yang and Kirchhoff (2006) have recently documented minor BLEU improvement using factored LMs in singlefactored SMT to English.
---------------------------------------------------
W08-0314:15	63:100	All nouns were then collected into a noun list, which was used by a simple compound splitter, as described in (Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006).

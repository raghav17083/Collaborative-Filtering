The problem is that we would need rules of the kind below (using context-free rules for short see (Prolo, 2002) for TAGs).


This has been noticed for TAGs in (Prolo, 2002).


3The same is true of other algorithms such as (Chen and Vijay-Shanker, 2000)s. 139 their realizations is an important issue here, and is also feasible (see (Kinyon and Prolo, 2002)).

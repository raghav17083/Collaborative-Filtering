There have been considerable amount of efforts to improve the reordering model in SMT systems, ranging from the fundamental distance-based distortion model (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al. , 2003), flat reordering model (Wu, 1996; Zens et al. , 2004; Kumar et al. , 2005), to lexicalized reordering model (Tillmann, 2004; Kumar et al. , 2005; Koehn et al. , 2005), hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005), and maximum entropy-based phrase reordering model (Xiong et al. , 2006). 
We did not use any reordering constraints, such as IBM constraint and ITG constraint in the search for the N-best phrase alignment (Zens et al. , 2004). 
Recently, many phrase reordering methods have been proposed, ranging from simple distancebased distortion model (Koehn  et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), flat reordering model (Wu, 1997; Zens et al., 2004), lexicalized reordering model (Tillmann, 2004; Kumar and Byrne, 2005), to hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005; Setiawan et al., 2007) and classifier-based reordering model with linear features (Zens and Ney, 2006; Xiong et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007a; Xiong et al., 2008). 
In the previous work (Zens et al., 2003, 2004), an IBM constraints and an ITG constraints are compared. 
Another simple model is flat reordering model (Wu, 1996; Zens et al. , 2004; Kumar et al. , 2005) which is not content dependent either.

3 The QLR Translation Module The (\]LR.* parser (Lavie and Tomita 11993; I,avie 1994) is a parsing system based on Tomita's Generalized LI~ parsing algorithm (Tomita 1987).


Although robustness has been heavily studied in natural language understanding (Weischedel and Black, 1980; Hayes, 1981; Lavie, 1994), it has received much less attention in NLG (Robin, 1995).

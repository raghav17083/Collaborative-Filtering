Of particular mention is the analysis of the relationship between speech repairs and parsing accuracy presented by Charniak and Johnson (2001), as this directly influenced our work. 
These steps result in a significant improvement in F-score over the earlier best result reported in [Charniak and Johnson 2001], where punctuation is included in both the training and testing data of the Switchboard corpus, and a significant error reduction in F-score over the latest best result [Johnson and Charniak 2004], where punctuation is ignored in both the training and testing data of the Switchboard corpus. 
3.2 Charniak-Johnson approach In [Charniak and Johnson 2001], identifying edited regions is considered as a classification problem, where each word is classified either as edited or normal. 
It would also be interesting to combine this probabilistic model of speech repairs with the word classi er approach of Charniak and Johnson (2001). 
We used the exactly same training and testing data from the Switchboard corpus as in [Charniak and Johnson 2001].

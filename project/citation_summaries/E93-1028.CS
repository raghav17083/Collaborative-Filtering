Lexical cohesiveness is defined as word similarity (Kozima and Furugori, 1993) computed by spreading activation on a semantic network. 
14 Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic Relatedness 2.1 Dictionary-based Approaches Kozima and Furugori (1993) turned the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter 1978) into a network by creating a node for every headword and linking each node to the nodes for all the words used in its definition. 
bwerted semrel structure from a definition of motorist Researchers who produced spreading activation networks from MRDs, including Veronis and Ide (1990) and Kozima and Furugori (1993), typically only implemented forward links (from headwords to their definition words) in those networks. 
The general idea is that words are related by the definition they appear in, in a complex network that must be semantic in nature (this has been also applied to word sense disambiguation, albeit with limited success (Veronis and Ide, 1990; H.Kozima and Furugori, 1993)). 
The graph then includes two types of nodes: w-nodes used for the words that occur 2With the exceptions of the methods of (Kozima and Furugori, 1993; Ide and Vronis, 1990), both based on models of activation of lexical relations, but who present no quantified results.

For example, the discriminative training techniques successfully applied in (Henderson, 2004) to the feed-forward neural network model can be directly applied to the mean field model proposed in this paper. 
Although the most accurate parsing models (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Henderson, 2004; Collins, 2000) are discriminative, all the most accurate discriminative models make use of a generative model. 
Although generating training examples in advance without a working parser (Sagae & Lavie, 2005) is much faster than using inference (Collins & Roark, 2004; Henderson, 2004; Taskar et al. , 2004), our training time can probably be decreased further by choosing a parsing strategy with a lower branching factor. 
Another previous approach is to use neural networks to compute a compressed representation of the history and condition decisions on this representation (Henderson, 2003; Henderson, 2004). 
Successful discriminative parsers have used generative models to reduce training time and raise accuracy above generative baselines (Collins & Roark, 2004; Henderson, 2004; Taskar et al. , 2004).

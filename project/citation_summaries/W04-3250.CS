The improvement in BLEU is statistically significant (p < 0.01) using the paired bootstrap resampling significance test (Koehn, 2004). 
Accordingly, in this section we describe a set of experiments which extends the work of (Way and Gough, 2005) by evaluating the Marker-based EBMT system of (Gough & Way, 2004b) against a phrase-based SMT system built using the following components:  Giza++, to extract the word-level correspondences;  The Giza++ word alignments are then refined and used to extract phrasal alignments ((Och & Ney, 2003); or (Koehn et al. , 2003) for a more recent implementation);  Probabilities of the extracted phrases are calculated from relative frequencies;  The resulting phrase translation table is passed to the Pharaoh phrase-based SMT decoder which along with SRI language modelling toolkit5 performs translation. 
5.1 Baseline The baseline system we used for comparison was Pharaoh (Koehn et al. , 2003; Koehn, 2004a), as publicly distributed. 
We measure statistical significance using 95% confidence intervals computed with paired bootstrap resampling(Koehn, 2004). 
A phrase-based translation model is one of the modern approaches which exploits a phrase, a contiguous sequence of words, as a unit of translation (Koehn et al. , 2003; Zens and Ney, 2003; Tillman, 2004).

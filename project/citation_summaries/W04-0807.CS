4.2 SENSEVAL-3 word sense disambiguation task The second task is word sense disambiguation using the SENSEVAL-3 corpus (Mihalcea et al. , 2004), to enable a comparison of our method with previously published results. 
The experiments are performed on the set of ambiguous nouns from the SENSEVAL-3 English lexical sample evaluation (Mihalcea et al. , 2004). 
At Senseval-3 (Mihalcea et al. , 2004) the top systems were considered to have reached a ceiling, in terms of performance, at 72% for finegrained disambiguation and 80% for coarsegrained. 
Table 4 also shows several unsupervised systems, all of which except Cymfony and (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004) participated in S3LS (check (Mihalcea et al. , 2004) for further details on the systems). 
Many corpus based statistical methods have been proposed to solve this problem, including supervised learning algorithms (Leacock et al. , 1998; Towel and Voorheest, 1998), weakly supervised learning algorithms (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Li and Li, 2004; Mihalcea, 2004; Niu et al. , 2005; Park et al. , 2000; Yarowsky, 1995), unsupervised learning algorithms (or word sense discrimination) (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997; Schutze, 1998), and knowledge based algorithms (Lesk, 1986; McCarthy et al. , 2004).

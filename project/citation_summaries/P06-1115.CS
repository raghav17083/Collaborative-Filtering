2.1 KRISP: The Supervised Semantic Parsing Learning System KRISP (Kernel-based Robust Interpretation for Semantic Parsing) (Kate and Mooney, 2006) is a supervised learning system forsemantic parsing which 81 takes NL sentences paired with their MRs as training data. 
Recently, researchers have developed techniques for learning to map sentences to hierarchical representations of their underlying meaning (Wong and Mooney, 2006; Kate and Mooney, 2006). 
KRISP (Kate and Mooney, 2006) is a semantic parser learning system which uses word subsequence kernel based SVM (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000) classifiers and was shown to be robust to noise compared to other semantic parser learners. 
2.2 KRISP: A Semantic Parser Learning System We very briefly describe the semantic parser learning system, KRISP (Kate and Mooney, 2006), which we will use as a base system for transforming MRGs, we however note that the MRG transformation methods presented in this paper are general enough to work with any system which learns semantic parser using MRGs. 
KRISP (Kate and Mooney, 2006) is a discriminative approach where meaning representation structures are constructed from the natural language strings hierarchically.

The resulting summary is then run through a named entity recovery tool (Nenkova and McKeown, 2003), which repairs named entity references in the summary by making the first reference descriptive, and shortening subsequent reference mentions in the summary. 
We automatically post-edited our summaries using a modi ed version of the module described in Nenkova and McKeown (2003). 
The syntactic forms of first mentionwhen an entity is first introduced in a textdiffer from those of subsequent mentions (Poesio and Vieira, 1998; Nenkova and McKeown, 2003) and can be exploited for improving and predicting text coherence (Siddharthan, 2003; Nenkova and McKeown, 2003; Elsner and Charniak, 2008). 
Nenkova and McKeown (2003) have studied this distinction for references to people in summaries and how it can be used to automatically rewrite summaries to achieve better uency and readability. 
We made use of two empirical observations made by Nenkova and McKeown (2003) based on human summaries: a rst mention is very likely to be modi ed in some way (probability of 0.76), and subsequent mentions are very unlikely to be postmodi ed (probability of 0.01 0.04).

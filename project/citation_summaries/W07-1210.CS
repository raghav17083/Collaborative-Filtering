In this paper, we focus on an approach to semantic representation that supports this strategy: Robust Minimal Recursion Semantics (RMRS, Copestake (2007a)).


RMRS (Copestake, 2007a) is designed to address this problem.


1 combines similarities to earlier presentations of RMRS (Copestake, 2003; Copestake, 2007b) and to CLLS/dominance constraints (Egg et al., 2001).

One problem is coverage: Most previous work has focused on acquiring selectional preferences for verbs and applying them to disambiguate nouns occurring at subject and direct object slots (Ribas 1995; McCarthy 1997; Abney and Light 1999; Ciaramita and Johnson 2000; Stevenson and Wilks 2001). 
In other approaches to requirement learning, linguistic conditions are defined in semantic terms by means of specific tags (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1992; Resnik 1997; Framis 1995). 
This is the approach taken by Li and Abe (1998), Ribas (1995), and McCarthy (2000). 
Previous work has considered how to estimate probabilities using classes from WordNet in the context of acquiring selectional preferences (Resnik 1998; Ribas 1995; Li and Abe 1998; McCarthy 2000), and this previous work has also addressed the question of how to determine a suitable level of generalization in the hierarchy. 
The learning algorithm requires sample corpora to be constituted by verb-noun, noun-verb, or verb-prepnoun dependencies, where the nouns are semantically tagged by using lexical hierarchies such as WordNet (Resnik, 1997; Framis, 1995).

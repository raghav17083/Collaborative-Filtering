Following on from Mellish et al., some work took place focusing on improving the evaluation function, for instance Cheng and Mellish (2000) expanded on the criteria for evaluating focus movement (there called discourse topic movement), and also allowed for embedding of facts in others, providing criteria for evaluating how good an embedding is. Karamanis also examined focus movement (or as he calls it, entity coherence) in text evaluation (Karamanis and Manurung 2002; Karamanis 2003; Karamanis et al. 2004; Karamanis and Mellish 2005).


Another approach is put forward by Cheng and Mellish (2000) who use a genetic algorithm in combination with a hand-crafted preference function to opportunistically find a text that satisfies aggregation and planning constraints.


4 Modeling Our model is inspired by research on text aggregation in the natural language generation community (Cheng and Mellish, 2000; Shaw, 1998).


Aggregated texts tend to be more concise, coherent, and more readable overall (Dalianis, 1999; Cheng and Mellish, 2000).

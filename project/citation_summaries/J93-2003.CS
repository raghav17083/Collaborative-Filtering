Model 1 is the word-pair translation model used in simple machine translation and understanding models (Brown et al. , 1993; Epstein et al. , 1996). 
2 Word Alignment algorithm We use IBM Model 4 (Brown et al. , 1993) as a basis for our word alignment system. 
Word correspondence was further developed in IBM Model-1 (Brown et al. , 1993) for statistical machine translation. 
This is a problem with other direct translation models, such as IBM model 1 used as a direct model rather than a channel model (Brown et al., 1993). 
4.3 Baselines 4.3.1 Word Alignment We used the GIZA++ implementation of IBM word alignment model 4 (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003) for word alignment, and the heuristics described in (Och and Ney, 2003) to derive the intersection and refined alignment.

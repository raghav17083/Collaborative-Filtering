3 Vector Approaches Patwardhan and Pedersen (2006) introduce a vector measure to determine the relatedness between pairs of concepts. 
Finally, Patwardhan and Pederson (2006) build on previous work on second-order co-occurrence vectors (Schutze, 1998) by constructing second-order co-occurrence vectors from WordNet glosses, where, as in (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003), the gloss of a concept is extended so that it includes the gloss of concepts to which it is directly related in WordNet. 
Mohammad and Hirst (2006) and Patwardhan and Pedersen (2006) argued that word sense ambiguity is a key reason for the poor performance of traditional distributional measures, and they proposed hybrid approaches that are distributional in nature, but also make use of information in lexical resources such as published thesauri and WordNet. 
The second way in which word sense and vector space models have been related is to assign disambiguated feature vectors to WordNet concepts (Pantel, 2005; Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006).

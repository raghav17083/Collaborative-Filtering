The modify features involve the dependency parse tree for the sentence, obtained by first parsing the sentence (Collins, 1997) and then converting the tree into its dependency representation (Xia and Palmer, 2001). 
2 Our Two-Step Solution 2.1 Grammar Formalism Conversion Previous DS to PS conversion methods built a converted tree by iteratively attaching nodes and edges to the tree with the help of conversion rules and heuristic rules, based on current headdependent pair from a source dependency tree and the structure of the built tree (Collins et al., 1999; Covington, 1994; Xia and Palmer, 2001; Xia et al., 2008). 
In batch mode, OpinionFinder parses the data again, this time to obtain constituency parse trees (Collins, 1997), which are then converted to dependency parse trees (Xia and Palmer, 2001). 
Previous methods for DS to PS conversion (Collins et al., 1999; Covington, 1994; Xia and Palmer, 2001; Xia et al., 2008) often rely on predefined heuristic rules to eliminate converison ambiguity, e.g., minimal projection for dependents, lowest attachment position for dependents, and the selection of conversion rules that add fewer number of nodes to the converted tree. 
To enable the surface realization of the English parses via RealPro, we automatically converted the phrase structures of the English Tree Bank into deep-syntactic dependency structures (DSyntSs) of the Meaning-Text Theory (MTT) (Melcuk, 1988) using Xias converter (Xia and Palmer, 2001) and our own conversion grammars.

NER proves to be a knowledgeintensive task, and it was reassuring to observe that System Resources Used F1 + LBJ-NER Wikipedia, Nonlocal Features, Word-class Model 90.80 (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008) Semi-supervised on 1Gword unlabeled data 89.92 (Ando and Zhang, 2005) Semi-supervised on 27Mword unlabeled data 89.31 (Kazama and Torisawa, 2007a) Wikipedia 88.02 (Krishnan and Manning, 2006) Non-local Features 87.24 (Kazama and Torisawa, 2007b) Non-local Features 87.17 + (Finkel et al., 2005) Non-local Features 86.86 Table 7: Results for CoNLL03 data reported in the literature. 
For example, Krishnan and Manning (2006) describe a system where a first-best CRF is used to analyse a corpus, the results of which are then used to generate additional features to use in a second first-best CRF.

While multiple machine learning approaches have been proposed for information extraction in recent years (McCallum et al., 2000; Cohen and McCallum, 2003; Klein et al., 2003; Krishnan and Manning, 2006), manually created regexes remain a widely adopted practical solution for information extraction (Appelt and Onyshkevych, 1998; Fukuda et al., 1998; Cunningham, 1999; Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002; Li et al., 2006; DeRose et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2007). 
Although several methods have already been proposed to incorporate non-local features (Sutton and McCallum, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2004; Finkel et al. , 2005; Roth and Yih, 2005; Krishnan and Manning, 2006; Nakagawa and Matsumoto, 2006), these present a problem that the types of non-local features are somewhat constrained.

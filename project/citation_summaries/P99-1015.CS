On the other hand, our approach is similar to the approaches of Siegel, and Lapata and Brew (1999), in attempting to learn semantic notions from distributions of 12 A baseline of 5% is reported, based on a closest-neighbor pairing of verbs, but it is not straightforward to compare this task to the proposed clustering algorithm. 
Linguistic indicators for aspectual classification are also used by Siegel (1999), who evaluates 14 indicators to test verbs for stativity and telicity. 
Other work has attempted to learn deeper semantic properties such as selectional restrictions (Resnik 1996; Riloff and Schmelzenbach 1998), verbal aspect (Klavans and Chodorow 1992; Siegel 1999), or lexical-semantic verb classes such as those proposed by Levin (1993) (Aone and McKee 1996; McCarthy 2000; Lapata and Brew 1999; Schulte im Walde 2000). 
Linguistic Indicators Aspectually categorizing verbs is the first step towards aspectually classifying clauses, since many clauses in certain domains can be categorized based on their main verb only (Siegel 1997, 1998b, 1999). 
Although the use of classifiers has been widespread in studies concerning discourse segmentation (Passonneau and Litman 1997), the disambiguation of discourse cues (Siegel and McKeown 1994), the acquisition of lexical semantic classes (Merlo and Stevenson 1999; Siegel 1999), the automatic identification of user corrections in spoken dialogue systems (Hirschberg, Litman, and Swerts 2001), and word sense disambiguation (Pedersen 2001), the treatment of the interpretation of compound nouns as a classification task is, to our knowledge, novel.

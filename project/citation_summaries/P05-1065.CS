Prior work on first language readability by Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) incorporated grammatical surface features such as parse tree depth and average number of verb phrases. 
(Si and Callan, 2001), (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004), (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005), and (Heilman et al., 2007) used language models to predict the suitability of texts for a given school grade level. 
Further recent refinements in methods for readability prediction include using machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005), log-linear models (Heilman et al., 2008), k-NN classifiers and combining semantic and grammatical features (Heilman et al., 2007). 
Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) developed a SVM categoriser combining a classifier based on trigram language models (one for each level of difficulty), some parsing features such as average tree height, and variables traditionally used in readability. 
Also, relatedly, (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005) use a statistical language model to train SVM classifiers to classify text for grade levels 2-5.

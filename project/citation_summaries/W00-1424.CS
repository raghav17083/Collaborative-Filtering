1 Introduction The generation of referring expressions is one of the most common tasks in natural language generation, and has been addressed by many researchers in the past two decades (including Appelt 1985, Dale 1992, Reiter 1990, Dale & Haddock 1991, Dale & Reiter 1995, Horacek 1997, Stone & Webber 1998, Krahmer & Theune 1999 and van Deemter 2000). 
Van Deemters (2000) proposal to generate distinguishing plural descriptions (such as the dogs) can be modeled using graphs in the following way. 
For example, we can reformulate the problem of determining the content of a distinguishing description in terms of hybrid logic (see e.g., Blackburn 2000) as follows: a228a105a229a231a230a78a232 A a233a20a234a236a235a238a237 a177 a233a55a239a35a240 a228a167a241a192a230a93a242 In words: when we want to refer to node a235, we are looking for that distinguishing formula a230 which is true of (at) a235 but not of any a233 different from a235 . One advantage of this perspective is that logical properties which are usually considered problematic from a generation perspective (such as not having a certain property), fit in very well with the logical perspective.

Van Deemters (2000) proposal to generate (distributional) distinguishing plural descripa39 A final advantage of the graph model certainly deserves further investigation is the following.

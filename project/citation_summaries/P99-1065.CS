3 Constituency Parsing for Dependency Trees A pragmatic justification for using constituencybased parsers in order to predict dependency structures is that currently the best Czech dependencytree parser is a constituency-based parser (Collins et al. , 1999; Zeman, 2004). 
Interest in parsing models for languages other than English has been growing, starting with work on Czech (Collins et al. , 1999) and Chinese (Bikel and Chiang, 2000; Levy and Manning, 2003). 
47 Feature Type Id Description Form F the fully inflected word form as it appears in the data Lemma L the morphologically reduced lemma MTag T a subset of the morphological tag as described in (Collins et al. , 1999) POS P major part-of-speech tag (first field of the morphological tag) ParserGov G true if candidate was proposed as governor by parser ChildCount C the number of children Agreement A(x,y) check for case/number agreement between word x and y Table 2: Description of the classes of features used In all models, we include features containing the form, the lemma, the morphological tag, and the ParserGov feature. 
COLL1999: The projective lexicalized phrase-structure parser of Collins et al. 
In an attempt to extend a constituency-based parsing model to train on dependency trees, Collins transforms the PDT dependency trees into constituency trees (Collins et al. , 1999).

Active learning has been applied to Statistical Parsing (Hwa, 2004; Baldridge and Osborne, 2003) to improve sample selection for manual annotation. 
Previous studies on probabilistic models for HPSG (Toutanova and Manning, 2002; Baldridge and Osborne, 2003; Malouf and van Noord, 2004) also adopted log-linear models. 
Baldridge and Osborne (2003) also applied AL to Redwoods. 
Other discriminative classifiers were applied to the disambiguation in HPSG parsing (Baldridge and Osborne, 2003; Toutanova et al. , 2004).

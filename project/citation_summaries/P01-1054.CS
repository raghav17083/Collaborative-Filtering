Where unique feature introduction is not assumed, it can be added automatically in O(F T) time, whereF is the number of features and T is the number of types (Penn, 2001).


This is actually consistent with HPSGs use of feature logic, although most TFS-based NLP systems do not sort resolve because type inference under sort resolution is NP-complete (Penn, 2001).

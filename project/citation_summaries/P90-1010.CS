For dialogue initiative annotation, I am using Walker and Whittakers utterance based allocation of control rules (Walker and Whittaker, 1990), which are widely used to identify dialogue initiative. 
This is a variable initiative dialog, as studied by Kitano and Van Ess-Dykema (1991), Novick (1988), Whittaker and Stenton (1988), and Walker and Whittaker (1990). 
Whittaker, Stenton, and Walker (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988; Walker and Whittaker, 1990) have previously identified a set of utterance intentions that serve as cues to indicate shifts or lack of shifts in initiative, such as prompts and questions. 
Future work must examine the interaction between centering and discourse segmentation in both monologue and dialogue (Whittaker and Stenton 1988; Walker and Whittaker 1990; Walker 1993b), and the role of deictics, lexical semantics, one anaphora, and propositional discourse entities in centering (Webber 1978; Sidner 1979; Walker 1992, 1993a; Cote 1995). 
Walker and Whittaker (1990) apply these dialogue control rules to analyze how initiative affects discourse structure.

2 Inside-out alignments Wu (1997) identified so-called inside-out alignments, two alignment configurations that cannot be induced by binary synchronous context-free grammars; these alignment configurations, while infrequent in language pairs such as EnglishFrench (Cherry and Lin, 2006; Wellington et al., 2006), have been argued to be frequent in other language pairs, incl. 
However, this method is more sophisticated to implement than the previous method and binarizability ratio decreases on freer word-order languages (Wellington et al. , 2006). 
It is for all three reasons, i.e. translation, induction from alignment structures and induction of alignment structures, important that the synchronous grammars are expressive enough to induce all the alignment structures found in hand-aligned gold standard parallel corpora (Wellington et al., 2006). 
One of the theoretical problems with phrase based SMT models is that they can not effectively model the discontiguous translations and numerous attempts have been made on this issue (Simard et al., 2005; Quirk and Menezes, 2006; Wellington et al., 2006; Bod, 2007; Zhang et al., 2007). 
We use the same alignment data for the five language pairs Chinese/English, Romanian/English, Hindi/English, Spanish/English, and French/English (Wellington et al. , 2006).

We cannot compare our word alignment result to (Moore, 2001), since the real rate of tokens that can be aligned by single-word translation pairs is not explicitly mentioned. 
We augment this with 19,762 translation correspondences acquired using statistical techniques described by Moore (2001). 
We refer to this below as the HanC system, because it uses a Hand-crafted Dictionary 2.Wechangedthisso that a learned dictionary consisting of wordassociations (Moore 2001) with parts of speech and a function word only bilingual dictionary (prepositions, conjunctions and pronouns) replaces the previous combination both at training and at runtime 3 . We refer to this as the 1 In both French-English and French-Spanish, we use a hand-crafted bilingual function word dictionary of about 500 entries. 
Previous works that focus on multi-word translation correspondences from parallel corpora include noun phrase correspondences (Kupiec, 1993), fixed/flexible collocations (Smadja et al. , 1996), n-gram word sequences of arbitrary length (Kitamura and Matsumoto, 1996), non-compositional compounds (Melamed, 2001), captoids (Moore, 2001), and named entities 1. 
This step is conservative and the same as step 5 in Moore (2001) or step 6(b) in Kitamura and Matsumoto (1996).

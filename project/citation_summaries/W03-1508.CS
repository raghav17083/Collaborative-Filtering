In machine transliteration, the noisy channel model (NCM), based on a phoneme-based approach, has recently received considerable attention (Meng et al. 2001; Jung et al, 2000; Virga & Khudanpur, 2003; Knight & Graehl, 1998). 
(Virga and Khudanpur, 2003) applied statistical machine translation models to translate English names into Chinese characters for Mandarin spoken document retrieval. 
Virga and Khudanpur (2003) reported 8.3% absolute accuracy drops when converting from Pinyin to Chinese character.

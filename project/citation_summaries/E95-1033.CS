Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) also define two rules on center movement and realization: 314 Strube and Hahn Functional Centering clauses tensed embedded same-level inaccessible accessible, less salient I I direct speech non-report complements reported speech relative clauses Figure 1 Kameyama's intrasentential centering categorization. 
The resolution of textual ellipses depends on the results of the foregoing resolution of nominal anaphors (Strube & Hahn, 1995) and the termination of the semantic interpretation of the current utterance. 
The attempt of directly Verifying BT restrictions on dependency structure, as suggested by Strube and Hahn (Strube and Hahn, 1995), does not seem adequate, because important details are ignored. 
The ordering constraints we supply account for all of the above mentioned types of anaphora in a precise way, including (pro)nominal anaphora (Strube & Hahn, 1995; Hahn & Strube, 1996). 
A resolution module for (pro)nominal anaphora (Strube and Hahn 1995) and one for functional anaphora (Hahn, Markert, and Strube 1996) based on this functional centering model has been implemented as part of PARSETALK, a comprehensive text parser for German (Hahn, Schacht, and Br6ker 1994; Hahn, Neuhaus, and Br6ker 1997) in our group.

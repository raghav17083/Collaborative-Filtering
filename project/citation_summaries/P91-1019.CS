Using MRD's (Amsler 1984) for word sense disambiguation was popularized by Lesk (1986); several researchers subsequently continued and improved this line of work (Krovetz and Croft 1989; Guthrie et al. 1991; V~ronis and Ide 1990).

tlowever, a number of researchers (l,'ilhnore, 1968; Grimshaw, 1990; Gruber, 1965; Guthrie et al. , 1991; Hearst, 1991; Jackendotr, 1983; Jackendoff, 1990; l,evin, 1993; Pinker, t989; Yarowsky, 1992) have demonstrated conclusively that there is a clear relationship between syntactic context and word senses; it is our aim to exploit this relationship for the acquisition of semantic lexicons. 
Several researchers have been experimented with lexical disambiguation using MRDs, including \[Lesk, 1986; Wilks et al. , 1989; McDonald et al. , 1990; Veronis and Ide, 1990; Guthrie et al. , 1991; Guthrie et al. , 1992\]. 
However, a number of researchers (Fillmore, 1968; Grimshaw, 1990; Gruber, 1965; Guthrie et al. , 1991; Hearst, 1991; Jackendoff, 1983; Jackendoff, 1990; Levin, 1993; Pinker, 1989; Yarowsky, 1992) have demonstrated conclusively that there is a clear relationship between syntactic context and word senses; it is our aim to exploit this relationship for the acquisition of semantic lexicons.

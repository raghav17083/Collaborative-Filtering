Saggion and Lapalme (2002) describe a system, SumUM, that generates indicativeinformative summaries from technical documents. 
To the best of our knowledge, and with the exception of Saggion and Lapalme (2002) indicative generation approach which included operations to add extra linguistic material to generate an indicative abstract, the work presented here is the first to investigate this relevant operation in the field of text abstracting and to propose a robust computational method for its simulation. 
Saggion and Lapalme (2002) have studied and implemented a rule-based verb selection operation in their SumUM system which has been applied to introduce document topics during indicative summary generation. 
prepositional phrase attachment (Pantel and Lin, 2000; Stetina and Nagao, 1997), co-reference resolution (Ng and Cardie, 2002) to text summarization (Saggion and Lapalme, 2002), semantic information is a necessary component in the inference, by providing a level of abstraction that is necessary for robust decisions. 
Sub-events (Daniel et al. , 2003) and sub-topics (Saggion and Lapalme, 2002) also contribute to the framework used for comparing documents in multidocument summarization.

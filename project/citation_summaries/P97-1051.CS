13 The importance of similar parallel elements in discourse relations is emphasized in Hobbs (1979), and it is applied to VPE resolution in Hobbs and Kehler (1997), in a rather different context than that of this paper. 
(Hobbs and Kehler, 1997) presents a general theory of parallelism and shows that it provides both a fine-grained analysis of the interaction between VP-ellipsis and pronominal anaphora and a general account of sloppy identity. 
There are a number of proposals (Hobbs and Kehler, 1997; Priist et al. , 1994; Asher, 1993; Asher et al. , 1997) adopting a similar approach to parallelism and semantics of which the most worked out is undoubtly (Hobbs and Kehler, 1997). 
It also extends its linguistic coverage (Niehren et al., 1997b) by integrating an analysis of VP ellipses with anaphora as in (Kehler, 1995). 
TM A clausal relation is simply an explicit syntactic clue that there is a discourse relation between two clauses, while similarity of parallel elements is another, more indirect clue of a discourse relation, as discussed for example in Hobbs (1979) and Hobbs and Kehler (1997).

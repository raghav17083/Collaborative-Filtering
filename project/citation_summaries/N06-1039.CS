2 Related Work Our system was inspired by the preemptive and ondemand IE approaches by Sekine and Shinyama (Sekine, 2006; Shinyama, 2006) that cluster newspaper articles into classes of articles that talk about the same type of event. 
2 Other research explores the task of open information extraction, where the predicates to be learned are not specified in advance (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006; Banko et al., 2007), but emerge instead from analysis of the data. 
Shinyama and Sekines preemptive IE system (2006) discovers relationships from sets of related news articles. 
An alternative approach, purely unsupervised information extraction, extracts strings of words between entities in large amounts of text, and clusters and simplifies these word strings to produce relation-strings (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006; Banko et al., 2007). 
Shinyama and Sekine (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006) describe an approach to unrestricted relation discovery that does away with many of the requirements for human input.

Statistics-Based Methods for Learning Linguistic Requirements During the last years, various stochastic approaches to linguistic requirements acquisition have been proposed (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1992; Hindle and Rooth 1993; Sekine et al. 1992; Grishman and Sterling 1994; Framis 1995; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1995; Resnik 1997; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1998; Marques, Lopes, and Coelho 2000; Ciaramita and Johnson 2000). 
The second approach (Sekine et al. 1992; Chang, Luo, and Su 1992; Resnik 1993a; Grishman and Sterling 1994; Alshawi and Carter 1994) takes triples (verb, prep, noun2) and (nounl, prep, noun2), like those in Table 10, as training data for acquiring semantic knowledge and performs PP-attachment disambiguation on quadruples. 
(1991), or with hyponym extraction based on entirely syntactic criteria as in Hearst (1992) or lexico-semantic associations (e.g., Resnik (1992) or Sekine et al. 
According to other learning approaches, the linguistic conditions used to characterize requirements may be situated at the lexical level (Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1998; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1995; Grishman and Sterling 1994; Sekine et al. 1992). 
By contrast, unsupervised strategies to acquire selection restrictions do not require a training corpus to be semantically annotated using pre-existing lexical hierarchies (Sekine et al. , 1992; Dagan et al. , 1998; Grishman and Sterling, 1994).

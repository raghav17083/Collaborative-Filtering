Miller et al (2000) augmented syntactic full parse trees with semantic information of entities and relations, and built generative models to integrate various tasks such as POS tagging, named entity recognition, template element extraction and relation extraction. 
Most other work on relation extraction focuses only on binary relations (Zelenko et al. , 2003; Miller et al. , 2000; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004). 
Many methods have been proposed to deal with this task, including supervised learning algorithms (Miller et al. , 2000; Zelenko et al. , 2002; Culotta and Soresen, 2004; Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et al. , 2005), semi-supervised learning algorithms (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zhang, 2004), and unsupervised learning algorithm (Hasegawa et al. , 2004). 
Miller et al (2000) augmented syntactic full parse trees with semantic information corresponding to entities and relations, and built generative models for the augmented trees. 
This includes parsing and relation extraction (Miller et al. , 2000), entity labeling and relation extraction (Roth and Yih, 2004), and part-of-speech tagging and chunking (Sutton et al. , 2004).

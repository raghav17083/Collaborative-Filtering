Finally, the top four candidates for the Telic role are kill, slit, cut and slice, whereby cut corresponds to the ideal filler of the qualia structure for knife as mentioned in (Johnston and Busa, 1996). 
1 Introduction Qualia Structures have been originally introduced by (Pustejovsky, 1991) and are used for a variety of purposes in Natural Language processing such as the analysis of compounds (Johnston and Busa, 1996), co-composition and coercion (Pustejovsky, 1991) as well as for bridging reference resolution (Bos et al. , 1995). 
4 Evaluation We evaluate our approach for the lexical elements knife, beer, book, which are also discussed in (Johnston and 31 Busa, 1996) or (Pustejovsky, 1991), as well as computer, an abstract noun, i.e. conversation, as well as two very specific multi-term words, i.e. natural language processing and data mining. 
The fillers of the Agentive role produce, make and create seem all appropriate, whereby make corresponds exactly to the ideal filler for the Agentive role as mentioned in (Johnston and Busa, 1996).

Much of the recent work in word alignment has focussed on improving the word alignment quality through better modeling (Och and Ney, 2003; Deng and Byrne, 2005; Martin et al. , 2005) or alternative approaches to training (Fraser and Marcu, 2006b; Moore, 2005; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005). 
(7) We randomly selected 512 Chinese-English (CE) sentence pairs and generated word alignment using the MaxEnt aligner (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005). 
Since the IBMAC gold alignments we use are not marked as such, AER reduces to 1 F-score (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005): Pr = |AS||A| Rc = |AS||S| AER = 1  2PrRcPr+Rc where A links are proposed and S links are gold. 
In 2005, however, several independent efforts (Liu et al. , 2005; Fraser and Marcu, 2005; Ayan et al. , 2005; Taskar et al. , 2005; Moore, 2005; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005) demonstrated that discriminatively trained models can equal or surpass the alignment accuracy of the standard models, if the usual unlabeled bilingual training corpus is supplemented with human-annotated word alignments for only a small subset of the training data. 
and (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005)), which also introduce many word alignment errors.

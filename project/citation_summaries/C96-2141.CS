Generative alignment models like the HMM model (Vogel et al. , 1996) and IBM models 4 and above (Brown et al. , 1990; Och and Ney, 2003) directly model correlations between alignments of consecutive words (at least on one side). 
One possible statistical model for word alignment is the HMM, which has been widely used for bilingual word alignment (Vogel et al., 1996, Och and Ney, 2003). 
In this paper we present extensions to the HMM alignment model of (Vogel et al. , 1996; Och and Ney, 2000b). 
We use the IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) and the Hidden Markov Model (HMM, (Vogel et al., 1996)) to estimate the alignment model. 
2.2 Word Alignment Aligning below the sentence level is usually done using statistical models for machine translation (Brown et al. , 1991; Brown et al. , 1993; Hiemstra, 1996; Vogel et al. , 1999) where any word of the targetlanguageistakentobeapossibletranslation for each source language word.

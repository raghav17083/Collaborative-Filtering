Most researchers working on word sense disambiguation (WSD) use manually sense tagged data such as SemCor (Miller et al. , 1993) to train statistical classifiers, but also use the information in SemCor on the overall sense distribution for each word as a backoff model. 
Cor text collection (Miller et al. , 1993), a subset of the Brown corpus manually tagged with WordNet senses (37,176 sentences in 352 newspaper articles). 
For training and testing, we used publicly available data sets, namely SEMCOR corpus (Miller et al. , 1993) and SENSEVAL English all-words task data. 
Existing hand-annotated corpora like SemCor (Miller et al. , 1993), which is annotated with WordNet senses (Fellbaum, 1998) allow for a small improvement over the simple most frequent sense heuristic, as attested in the all-words track of the last Senseval competition (Snyder and Palmer, 2004). 
The method suggested trains a neural network using the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm, integrating several semantic relations of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and SemCor corpus (Miller et al. , 1993).

1 Introduction Parsing technologies have improved considerably in the past few years, and high-performance syntactic parsers are no longer limited to PCFG-based frameworks (Charniak, 2000; Klein and Manning, 2003; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Petrov and Klein, 2007), but also include dependency parsers (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; Sagae and Tsujii, 2007) and deep parsers (Kaplan et al., 2004; Clark and Curran, 2004; Miyao and Tsujii, 2008). 
Previous studies (Abney, 1997; Johnson et al. , 1999; Riezler et al. , 2000; Miyao et al. , 2003; Malouf and van Noord, 2004; Kaplan et al. , 2004; Miyao and Tsujii, 2005) defined a probabilistic model of unification-based grammars as a log-linear model or maximum entropy model (Berger et al. , 1996). 
Against the PARC 700, the hand-crafted LFG grammar reported in (Kaplan et al. , 2004) achieves an fscore of 79.6%.

Other researches have focused on manually creating frame annotated corpora for languages different from English, these including German (Burchardt et al., 2006), Spanish (Subirats and Petruck, 2003), Japanese (Ohara et al., 2004) and French (Pitel, 2006).

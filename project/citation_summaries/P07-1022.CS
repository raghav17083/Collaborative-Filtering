When DMV generates an argument, the part-of-speech of that argument A is generated given H and d. 1Efficiently parsable versions of split-head bilexical CFGs for the models described in this paper can be derived using the fold-unfold grammar transform (Eisner and Blatz, 2007; Johnson, 2007). 
As a prior, for each N  N we will specify a 102 Dirichlet distribution over  N with hyperparameters  N. The Dirichlet has the density function: P( N| N) = ( summationtext r RN r)producttext r RN (r) productdisplay r RN r1r , Thus the prior over  is a product of Dirichlets,which is conjugate to the PCFG likelihood function (Johnson et al., 2007). 
214 plying transformations, closely related to those in (McAllester, 1999) and (Johnson, 2007), that eliminate the 2lv and 2rv symbols. 
Adopting an approach similar to Johnson (2007), we look at the direction (left or right) of the head with respect to the modifier; we consequently define a set D = {l,r} to represent this. 
These allow us to use the fast Eisner and Satta (1999) parsing algorithm to compute the expectations required by VB in O(m3) time (Eisner and Blatz, 2007; Johnson, 2007) where m is the length of the sentence.1 In the split-head bilexical CFG framework, each nonterminal in the grammar is annotated with a terminal symbol.

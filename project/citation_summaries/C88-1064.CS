Kataja and Koskenniemi (1988) were apparently the first to understand that concatenating languages were just a special case; they showed that by generalizing lexicography to allow regular expressions, Semitic (specifically Akkadian) roots and patterns could denote regular languages, and that stems could be computed as the intersection of these regular languages. 
Kataja and Koskenniemi (1988) present a system for handling Akkadian root-and-pattern morphology by adding an additional lexicon component to Koskenniemis two-level morphology (1983). 
2 Arabic Morphotactics Arabic and other Semitic languages are most notable for having a partially non~concatenative morphotactics wherein STEMS are formed by the interdigitation of ROOTS and PATTERNS, a process naturally formalized in finite-state morphology as intersection (Kataja and Koskenniemi, 1988; Beesley, 1996; Beesley, 1998). 
While the original Two-Level formulation (Koskenniemi, 1983) of finite-state technology for morphology was not particularly well suited to Semitic languages (Lavie et al. , 1988), modifications of the Two-Level paradigm and more advanced finite-state implementations have been applied successfully to a variety of Semitic languages, including Ancient Akkadian (Kataja and Koskenniemi, 1988), Syriac (Kiraz, 2000) and Arabic. 
The language model which finite-state methods have been most successful in describinga model where morphemes concatenate in mostly strict linear orderdoes not translate congenially to the type of root-and-pattern morphology found in e.g. Arabic and Hebrew (Kataja and Koskenniemi, 1988; Lavie et al., 1988).

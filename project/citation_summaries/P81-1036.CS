Thompson (1981) is another fundamental source, though he discusses the effects of various ruleinvocation strategies mainly from the perspective of GPSG parsing which is not the main point here. 
The basic parsing algorithm we use is a chart parser (Thompson 1981, Thompson and Ritchie, 1984). 
The most advanced parser for Gazdar-style grammars that we are aware of is Thompson's chartparser (Thompson 1981), which provides for slash categories and coordination, but does not (as of this writing) generate logical translations. 
2 Incremental Chart Parsing 2.1 Chart Parsing The incremental parser has been grounded in a chart-parsing framework (Kay 1980, Thompson 1981, Thompson and Ritchie 1984) for the following reasons:  chart parsing is an efficient, open-ended, well understood, and frequently adopted technique in natural-language processing;  chart parsing gives us a previously unexplored possibility of embedding incrementality at a low cost. 
SThe ~raldeter operation in Earley (1970); the ~ndarnentad rule in Thompson (1981:2).

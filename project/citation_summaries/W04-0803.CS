W07-2005:1	39:145	This task has been the subject of a previous Senseval task (Automatic Semantic Role Labeling, Litkowski (2004)) and two shared tasks on semantic role labeling in the Conference on Natural Language Learning (Carreras & Marquez (2004) and Carreras & Marquez (2005)).
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1008:2	14:220	The NLP community has recently devoted much attention to developing accurate and robust methods for performing role-semantic analysis automatically, and a number of multi-system evaluations have been carriedout(Litkowski, 2004; CarrerasandMrquez, 2005; Baker et al., 2007; Surdeanu et al., 2008).
---------------------------------------------------
D08-1008:3	116:220	The inappropriateness of the traditional metric has led to a number of alternative metrics (Litkowski, 2004; Baker et al., 2007; Surdeanu et al., 2008).
---------------------------------------------------
W07-1424:4	146:170	Although automatic semantic parsing is a large and growing field (Moldovan et al. , 2004; Litkowski, 2004; Baldewein et al. , 2004), two problems present themselves.
---------------------------------------------------
J08-2001:5	60:86	5.EmpiricalEvaluationsofSRLSystems Many experimental studies have been conducted since the work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), including seven international evaluation tasks in ACL-related conferences and workshops: the SIGNLL CoNLL shared tasks in 2004 and 2005 (Carreras and M`arquez 2004, 2005), the SIGLEX Senseval-3 in 2004 (Litkowski 2004), and four tasks in the SIGLEX SemEval in 2007 (Pradhan et al.2007; M `arquez et al.2007; Baker, Ellsworth, and Erk 2007; Litkowski and Hargraves 2007).In the subsequent sections, we summarize their main features, results, and conclusions, although note that the scores are not directly comparable across different exercises, due to differences in scoring and in the experimental methodologies.
---------------------------------------------------
J08-2001:6	66:86	In Senseval-3, 40 frames were selected for an SRL task with the goal of replicating Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) and improving on them (Litkowski 2004).Participants were evaluated on assigning semantic roles to given arguments, with best F 1 of 92%, and on the task of segmenting and labeling arguments, with best F 1 of 83%.
---------------------------------------------------
J08-2001:7	19:86	146 M`arquez, Carreras, Litkowski, and Stevenson Semantic Role Labeling 2.SemanticRolesinLinguistics Since the foundational work of Fillmore (1968), considerable linguistic research has been devoted to the nature of semantic roles.Although there is substantial agreement on major semantic roles, such as Agent and Theme, there is no consensus on a denitive list of semantic roles, or even whether such a list exists.Proposed lists range from a large set of situation-specic roles, such as Suspect, Authorities, and Offense (Fillmore, Ruppenhofer, and Baker 2004), to a relatively small set of general roles, such as Agent, Theme, Location, and Goal (typically referred to as thematic roles, as in Jackendoff [1990]), to the set of two core roles, Proto-Agent and Proto-Theme, whose entailments determine the precise relation expressed (Dowty 1991).This uncertainty within linguistic theory carries over into computational work on SRL, where there is much variability on the roles assumed in different resources.
---------------------------------------------------
W07-2018:8	94:162	This task is a more advanced and realistic version of the Automatic Semantic Role Labeling task of Senseval-3 (Litkowski, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
H05-1084:9	10:183	Typically, role assignment has been modeled as a classification task, with models being estimated from large corpora (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Moschitti, 2004; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Surdeanu et al. , 2003; Pradhan et al. , 2004; Litkowski, 2004; Carreras and Mrquez, 2005).
---------------------------------------------------
C08-1050:10	76:214	The inappropriateness of the traditional metric has led to a number of alternative metrics (Litkowski, 2004; Baker et al., 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
C08-1050:11	11:214	role-semantic analysis automatically (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Litkowski, 2004; Carreras and Mrquez, 2005; Baker et al., 2007).
---------------------------------------------------
W06-2611:12	11:216	On the FrameNet (Johnson et al. , 2003) role labeling task, the Senseval-3 competition (Litkowski, 2004) registered similar results (~80%) by using the gold frame information as a given feature.
---------------------------------------------------
W06-2611:13	42:216	Several models have been developed for the automatic detection of the frame elements based on the FrameNet corpus (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Thompson et al. , 2003; Litkowski, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
W09-2417:14	9:146	Identifying the semantic roles of the predicates in a text allows knowing who did what to whom when where how, etc. SRL has attracted much attention in recent years, as witnessed by several shared tasks in Senseval/SemEval (M`arquez et al., 2007; Litkowski, 2004; Baker et al., 2007; Diab et al., 2007), and CoNLL (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005; Surdeanu et al., 2008).
---------------------------------------------------
W06-1617:15	8:156	1 Introduction Automatic Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) systems, made possible by the availability of PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2003; Palmer et al. , 2005), and encouraged by evaluation efforts in (Carreras and Marquez, 2005; Litkowski, 2004), have been shown to accurately determine the argument structure of verb predicates.
---------------------------------------------------
W07-2016:16	75:117	Traditionally, SRL systems have been trained on either the PropBank corpus (Palmer et al. , 2005) ??for two years, the CoNLL workshop (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005) has made this their shared task, or the FrameNet corpus ??Senseval-3 used this for their shared task (Litkowski, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
E06-1044:17	169:218	Beginning with work by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), there has been a large interest in semantic role labelling, as evidenced by its adoption as a shared task in the Senseval-III competition (FrameNet data, Litkowski, 2004) and at the CoNLL-2004 and 2005 conference (PropBank data, Carreras and Mrquez, 2005).
---------------------------------------------------
W07-2021:18	15:107	This work attempts to expand on semantic role labeling experiments in Senseval-3 (Litkowski, 2004a, and Litkowski, 2004b).
---------------------------------------------------
P06-2057:19	169:194	Although the strict measures are more interesting, we include these figures for comparison with the systems participating in the Senseval-3 Restricted task (Litkowski, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
P06-2057:20	46:194	The result is slightly lower than the best systems at Senseval3 (Litkowski, 2004), possibly because we used a larger set of frames, and we did not assume that the frame was known a priori.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-2057:21	8:194	Building SRL systems for English has been studied widely (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Litkowski, 2004), inter alia.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1117:22	39:216	Several models have been developed for the automatic detection of the frame elements based on the FN corpus (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Thompson et al. , 2003; Litkowski, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1117:23	13:216	The same problem was again highlighted by the results obtained with and without the frame information in the Senseval-3 competition (Litkowski, 2004) of FrameNet (Johnson et al. , 2003) role labeling task.
---------------------------------------------------
P06-1117:24	55:216	Also from these 321 frames only 100 were considered to have enough training data and were used in Senseval-3 (see (Litkowski, 2004) for more details).
---------------------------------------------------
E06-2013:25	7:91	Building English semantic parsers for the FrameNet standard has been studied widely (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Litkowski, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
E06-2013:26	71:91	Stage 2, most of them are well-known from previous literature on FE identification and labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Litkowski, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
W05-0620:27	13:334	In addition to the CoNLL-2004 shared task, another evaluation exercise was conducted in the Senseval-3 workshop (Litkowski, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
W05-1001:28	31:164	To date PropBank and FrameNet are the two main resources in English for training semantic role labelling systems, as in the CoNLL-2004 shared task (Carreras and Mrquez, 2004) and SENSEVAL-3 (Litkowski, 2004).
---------------------------------------------------
P07-1027:29	20:194	Noun predicates also appear in FrameNet semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and many FrameNet SRL systems are evaluated in Senseval-3 (Litkowski, 2004).

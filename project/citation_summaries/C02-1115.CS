ME have been also applied to WSD (van Halteren et al. , 2001; Montoyo and Suarez, 2001; Suarez and Palomar, 2002), and as meta-learner in (Ilhan et al. , 2001).


We decided to use ME as the core of our bootstrapping method because it has shown to be competitive in WSD when compared to other machine learning approaches (Suarez and Palomar, 2002; M`arquez et al. , 2003).

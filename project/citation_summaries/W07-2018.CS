LU induction has been integrated at SemEval-2007 as part of the Frame Semantic Structure Extraction shared task (Baker et al., 2007), where systems are requested to assign the correct frame to a given LU, even when the LU is not yet present in FrameNet. 
Joint scoring and combination components open the door to richer types of features, which may take into account global properties of the candidate solution plus dependencies among the different arguments.The most remarkable work in this direction is the reranking approach by Toutanova, Haghighi, and Manning in this issue.When training the ranker to select the best candidate solution they codify pattern features as strings containing the whole argument structure of the candidate.Several variations of this type of feature (with different degrees of generalization to avoid sparseness) allow them to signicantly increase the performance of the base system.Also related, Pradhan et al.(2005b) and Surdeanu et al.(2007) convert the condence scores of several base SRL systems into features for training a nal machine learningbased combination system.Surdeanu et al.(2007) develop a broad spectrum of features, with sentencebased information, describing the role played by the candidate argument in every solution proposed by the different base SRL systems. 
A variety of methods have been developed for semantic role labeling with reasonably good performance (F1 measures in the low 80s on standard test collections for English; we refer the interested reader to the proceedings of the SemEval-2007 shared task (Baker et al., 2007) for an overview of the state-of-the-art). 
And while the MULTEXT-East tagset and corpus encoding practices have been adopted for a number of Slovene corpora, among them the reference corpora FIDA (Erjavec et al., 1998) and FidaPLUS (Arhar and Gorjanc, 2007), the 1984 corpus itself is nevertheless small (100,000 words) and contains only one translated novel, resulting in very brittle tagging models (Erjavec and S</context> <context> procedure; Section 5. 
The inappropriateness of the traditional metric has led to a number of alternative metrics (Litkowski, 2004; Baker et al., 2007).

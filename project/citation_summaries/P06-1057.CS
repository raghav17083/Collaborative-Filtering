Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD): Since previous work indicated the usefulness of word sense disambiguation systems in lexical substitution (Dagan et al. , 2006), we use the SenseLearner word sense disambiguation tool (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2005) to disambiguate the target word and, accordingly, to propose its synonyms as candidates. 
2.2 Paraphrasing in MT A recent strategy to broadly deal with the problem of unknown terms is to paraphrase the source text with terms whose translation is known to the system, using paraphrases learnt from multilingual corpora, typically involving at least one pivot language different from the target language of immediate interest (Callison-Burch et 792 al., 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Zhao et al., 2008; Callison-Burch, 2008; Guzman and Garrido, 2008). 
In the literature, slight variations of this problem are also referred to as sense matching (Dagan et al. , 2006), lexical reference (Glickman et al. , 2006a) and lexical substitution (Glickman et al. , 2006b). 
Finding alternative words that can occur in given contexts would potentially be useful to many applications such as question answering, summarisation, paraphrase acquisition (Dagan et al. , 2006), text simplification and lexical acquisition (McCarthy, 2002). 
The approach we present here is inspired by (Mihalcea and Moldovan 1999;Brill 2003; Rosso et al. 2005; Dagan et al. 2006; McCarthy 2002).

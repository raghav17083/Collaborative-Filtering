Preliminary experiments acquiring a few 356 verbal subcategorization classes have been reported by Brent (1991, 1993), Manning (1993), and Ushioda et al. 
The different approaches (e.g. Brent, !991, 1993; Ushioda et al. , 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Manning, 1993; Carroll and Rooth, 1998; Gahl, 1998; Lapata, 1999; Sarkar and Zeman, 2000) vary largely according to the methods used and the number of SCFS being extracted. 
Over the past years acquiring subcategorization dictionaries from textual corpora has become increasingly popular (e.g. Brent, 1991, 1993; Ushioda et al. , 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Manning, 1993; Carroll and Rooth 1998; Gahl, 1998; Lapata, 1999, Sarkar and Zeman, 2000). 
Systems which are able to acquire a small number of verbal subcategorisation classes automatically from corpus text have been described by Brent (1991, 1993), and Ushioda et al. 
5 Comparison with related work Preliminary work on SF extraction from coq~ora was done by (Brent, 1991; Brunt, 1993; Brent, 1994) and (Webster and Marcus, 1989; Ushioda et al. , 1993).

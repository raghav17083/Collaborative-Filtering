This improvement in coverage is largely comparable to the result reported in (Zhang et al. , 2006), where the coverage was reported to raise from 5% to 18% with theword with spacesapproach (see also section 4). 
Here we concentrate on a single corpus, BNCf, and compare the three statistical measures for MWE identification: Mutual Information (MI), 2 and Permutation Entropy (PE)(Zhang et al. , 2006), to investigate if they order the trigrams in the same fashion. 
Most progress has been made especially in the field of multiword identification (Villada Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Zhang et al. , 2006). 
Since this formal representation is in agreement with a de facto standard for Dutch (van Noord et al. , 2006), most Dutch NLP systems are able to use it for the conversion procedure, yielding an optimal reduction of manual labor. 
Since we are only interested in acquiring new lexical entries for MWEs which are not covered by the grammar, we used the error mining results (Zhang et al. , 2006; van Noord, 2004) to only keep those candidates with parsability  0.1.

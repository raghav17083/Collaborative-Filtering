We have developed the underlying infrastructure required to make this possibility a reality, and we now have the capabilit y to begin experimenting with strategies for specifying patterns, and learning patterns from examples . The other area of research suggested by our serendipitous bug is to investigate more principle d means for combining the results of low-recall high-precision analysis, and high-recall low-precisio n analysis . Our experience in this evaluation suggests that there may be strategies based on partial information, and textual proximity that yield promising results, particularly for applications i n which some sacrifice of precision for increased recall is reasonable .

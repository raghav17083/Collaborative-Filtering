LDA is already successfully applied to enhance document representations in text classification (Blei et al., 2003), information retrieval (Wei and Croft., 2006). 
However, empirical study shows that NE types have different distribution across domains (Guo et al., 2006). 
These models have been successfully employed in topic modeling, dimensionality reduction for text categorization (Blei et al., 2003), ad hoc IR (Wei and Croft., 2006), and so on. 
5.3.2 Accuracy Enhancement for Each NE Type Recognition Our statistic data (Guo et al., 2006) show that the distribution of NE types varies with domains. 
While multiple machine learning approaches have been proposed for information extraction in recent years (McCallum et al., 2000; Cohen and McCallum, 2003; Klein et al., 2003; Krishnan and Manning, 2006), manually created regexes remain a widely adopted practical solution for information extraction (Appelt and Onyshkevych, 1998; Fukuda et al., 1998; Cunningham, 1999; Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002; Li et al., 2006; DeRose et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2007).

This algorithm has been applied to a number of natural language problems, including part-of-speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation, and syntactic parsing (Brill 1992; Brill 1993a; Brill 1993b; Brill and Resnik 1994; Brill 1994). 
In this paper we consider transformation-based parsing, introduced in (Brill, 1993), and we improve upon the O(Trpn) time upper bound In transformation-based parsing, an ordered sequence of tree-rewriting rules (tree transformations) are applied to an initial parse structure for an input sentence, to derive the final parse structure. 
Transformation-based tagging as introduced by Brill (1993) also requires a handtagged text for training. 
A somewhat indirect comparison of applying stochastic context-free grammars (Periera & Shabes, 1992), a transformation-based method (Brill, 1993), and inductive logic programming (Zelle & Mooney, 1994) to parsing the ATIS (Airline Travel Information Service) corpus from the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, & Marcinkiewicz, 1993) indicates fairly similar performance for these three very different methods. 
See Brill (1993) and Hermjakob and Mooney (1997) for rule-based learning systems.

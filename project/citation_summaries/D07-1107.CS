Several researchers (e.g., (Palmer et al., 2004; Navigli, 2006; Snow et al., 2007; Hovy et al., 2006)) work on reducing the granularity of sense inventories for WSD. 
Current work investigates the impact of the semantic distribution of the classes of instances on the overall accuracy of attributes; the potential benefits of using more compact conceptual hierarchies (Snow et al., 2007) on attribute accuracy; and the organization of labeled classes of instances into conceptual hierarchies, as an alternative to inserting them into existing conceptual hierarchies created manually from scratch or automatically by filtering manually-generated relations among classes from Wikipedia (Ponzetto and Strube, 2007). 
For example, the coarser word grouping obtained in (Snow et al., 2007) only has one remaining sense for church. 
Factors that have been proposed as affecting human or system sense disambiguation include whether annotators are allowed to assign multilabels (Veronis, 1998; Ide et al., 2002; Passonneau et al., 2006), the number or granularity of senses (Ng et al., 1999), merging of related senses (Snow et al., 2007), sense similarity (Chugur et al., 2002), sense perplexity (Diab, 2004), entropy (Diab, 2004; Palmer et al., 2005), and in psycholinguistic experiments, reactions times required to distinguish senses (Klein and Murphy, 2002; Ide and Wilks, 2006). 
We plan to improve the verb class model with respect to (i) a concept-wise (instead of a cut-wise) implementation of the MDL principle, to operate on concepts instead of combinations of concepts; and (ii) variations of the concept hierarchy, using e.g. the sense-clustered WordNets from the Stanford WordNet Project (Snow et al., 2007), or a WordNet version improved by concepts from DOLCE (Gangemi et al., 2003), to check on the influence of conceptual details on the clustering results.

1 Introduction Research in cooperative response generation has had a long history and produced many useful algorithms and observations (Mays 1980; Pollack et al.1982; Joshi et al., 1986; Kalita et al., 1986) inter alia.


A number of proposals have emphasized the importance of making generalizations (Kaplan, 1984; Kalita et al., 1986; Joshi et al., 1986).


U = User to more natural, effective, or efficient dialogues (Litman et al.1998; Demberg and Moore, 2006); and (2) Previous work has hand-crafted such responses, or hand-annotated the database to support them (Kaplan, 1984; Kalita et al., 1986; Cholvy, 1990; Polifroni et al., 2003; Benamara, 2004), which has made it difficult to port and scale these algorithms.

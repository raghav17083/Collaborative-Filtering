Koeling (2000) used a standard maximum-entropy learner for generating chunk tags from words and POS tags. 
In the past, most researchers resorted to count cutoff technique in selecting features for ME modeling (Rosenfeld, 1994; Ratnaparkhi, 1998; Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Koeling, 2000). 
1 Introduction Conditional Maximum Entropy (CME) modeling has received a great amount of attention within natural language processing community for the past decade (e.g. , Berger et al. , 1996; Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Koeling, 2000; Malouf, 2002; Zhou et al. , 2003; Riezler and Vasserman, 2004). 
ME-based tagger, in particular, excel at solving sequence tagging problems such as POS tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1997), general English NER (Borthwick, 1999), and Chunking (Koeling, 2000). 
In the past, most researchers resorted to a simple count cutoff technique for selecting features (Rosenfeld, 1994; Ratnaparkhi, 1998; Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Koeling, 2000), where only the features that occur in a corpus more than a predefined cutoff threshold get selected.

(Wang and Zhou, 2004) investigated the benefit of monolingual parsing for alignment.


Deeper syntax, e.g. phrase or dependency structures, has been shown useful in generative models (Wang and Zhou, 2004; Lopez and Resnik, 2005), heuristic-based models (Ayan et al., 2004; Ozdowska, 2004) and even for syntactically motivated models such as ITG (Wu, 1997; Cherry and Lin, 2006).

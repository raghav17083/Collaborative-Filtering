2.1 Parsing as Weighted Deduction Our algorithm can be formulated in terms of prioritized weighted deduction rules (Shieber et al., 1995; Nederhof, 2003; Felzenszwalb and McAllester, 2007). 
The best weight (v) of a vertex v is the weight of the best derivation of v: (v)= braceleftBigg 1 v is a source vertex circleplustext DD(v) w(D) otherwise (6) 4.3 Related Formalisms Hypergraphs are closely related to other formalisms like AND/OR graphs, context-free grammars, and deductive systems (Shieber et al., 1995; Nederhof, 2003). 
Therefore, non-local parameterizations break semiringweighted deduction, because we can no longer use 7General weighted deduction subsumes semiringweighted deduction (Eisner et al., 2005; Eisner and Blatz, 2006; Nederhof, 2003), but semiring-weighted deduction covers all translation models we are aware of, so it is a good first step in applying weighted deduction to translation. 
In previous work such as (Goodman, 1999; Nederhof, 2003), one only specifies the inference rules as unweighted Horn clauses, and then weights are added automatically in a standard way: all values have the same type W, and all rules transform to equations of the form c = a1  a2    ak, where  and  give W the structure of a semiring.4 In Dyna one writes these equations explicitly in place of Horn clauses (Fig. 
modeling flexibility than the weighted deductive systems of Nederhof (2003): in the former we can have a separate weight function for each hyperedge, where as in the latter, the weight function is defined for a deductive (template) rule which corresponds to many hyperedges.

2 This is because the recognition problem for an arbitrary "unification-based" grammar is undecidable unless the size of the phrase structure tree is constrained somehow, e.g., by the offiine parsability constraint (Johnson 1988; Kaplan and Bresnan 1982; Pereira 1982; Shieber 1992), but there seems to be no natural way to impose such constraints in these systems because the encoding of the phrase structure tree in the feature structure is not distinguished from other features. 
1 For examples of this approach see Dawar and Vijay-Shanker (1990), D6rre and Eisele (1990), Johnson (1988, 1990a, 1990b, 1991a, 1991b, in press a), Karttunen (1984), Kasper (1987a, 1987b, 1988), Kasper and Rounds (1986, 1990), Langholm (1989), Pereira (1987), and Smolka (1992). 
Even in the most purely linguistic area, coordination has not received in-depth treatment, if not recently (for example, see \[Sag et al. , 1984\] and \[Kaplan and Maxwell, 1988\]). 
uncertainty constraints, used in the LFG treatment of long-distance dependencies (Kaplan and Zaenen 1989) appear to have a decidable satisfiability problem (Kaplan and Maxwell 1988a), but the satisfiability problem for arbitrary boolean combinations of functional uncertainty constraints is undecidable (Keller 1991), so these cannot be expressed using SB formulae either (since the quantifier-free subclass of SB is closed under boolean operations).

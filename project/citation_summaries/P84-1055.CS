As the result of classifying these 31 cue phrases based on the classification of Japanese connectives (Ichikawa, 1978; Moriyama, 1997) and cue phrase classification in Enghsh (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Cohen, 1984; Knott and Dale, 1994; Moser and Moore, 1995b), 20 cue phrases, which occurred total of 848 times, were classified into three classes: changeover, such as soredeha, deha ("now", "now then" in English), conjunctive, such as sore.de, de ("and", "and then"), and ordinal, such as mazu, tsugini ("first", "next"). 
Theory of Discourse Structure Other theories have defined the relata in discourse structure as clauses (Trabasso and Sperry, 1985), pieces of text (Hobbs, 1985, Mann and Thompson, 1987), pieces of text plus connectives ( Cohen, 1984, Reichman, 1985), propositions (Van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983, Polanyi, 1988), plans (Lochbaum, Grosz and Sidner, 1990) and segmented discourse representation structures, the SDRT theory (Asher, 1993). 
The segmental structure of discourse has been claimed to constrain and be constrained by disparate phenomena: cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Gross and Sidner, 1986; Reichman, 1985; Cohen, 1984); lexical cohesion (Morris and Hirst, 1991); plans and intentions (Carberry, 1990; Litman and Allen, 1990; Gross and Sidner, 1986); prosody (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Gross, 1992; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert, 1986); reference (Webber, 1991; Gross and Sidner, 1986; Linde, 1979); and tense (Webber, 1988; Hwang and Schubert, 1992; Song and Cohen, 1991). 
In previous studies that have investigated the relationship between cue phrases and the types of structural change (e.g. pop, push), the taxonomies of cue phrases have been presented (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Cohen, 1984; Schiffrin, 1987). 
For example, the discourse use of and is defined as 'parallelism' in Cohen (1984), 'a marker of addition' or 'sequential continuity' in Schriffin (1987), and 'conjunction' in Warner (1985).

A supervised approach for word-sense disambiguation is used following Bruce and Wiebe (1999). 
Many standard M L algorithms for supervised learning have been applied, such as: Decision Lists (Yarowsky, 1994; Agirre and Martinez, 2000), Neural Networks (Towell and Voorhees, 1998), Bayesian learning (Bruce and Wiebe, 1999), Exemplar-based learning (Ng, 1997), Boosting (Escudero et al. , 2000a), etc. Further, in (Mooney, 1996) some of the previous methods are compared jointly with Decision Trees and Rule Induction algorithms, on a very restricted domain. 
Again, see Cucchiarelli, Luzi and Velardi (1998) and Bruce and Wiebe, (1999) for examples of similarity functions.

An analysis of this issue as applied to probabilistic WSD learners may be found in Bruce and Wiebe (1999).

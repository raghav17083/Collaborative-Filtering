The approach described in Clark and Weir (1999) is shown in Clark (2001) to have some impact on the pseudo-disambiguation task, but only with certain values of the  parameter, and ultimately does not improve on the best performance. 
In (Schubert, 2002) we made some comparisons between our project and earlier work in knowledge extraction (e.g. , (muc, 1993; muc, 1995; muc, 1998; Berland and Charniak, 1999; Clark and Weir, 1999; Hearst, 1998; Riloff and Jones, 1999)) and in discovery of selectional preferences (e.g. , (Agirre and Martinez, 2001; Grishman and Sterling, 1992; Resnik, 1992; Resnik, 1993; Zernik, 1992; Zernik and Jacobs, 1990)). 
Alternative approaches are described in Clark and Weir (1999) (see also Clark [2001]), Abney and Light (1999), and Ciaramita and Johnson (2000). 
Among early efforts, one might count work on deriving selectional preferences (e.g., Zernik (1992); Resnik (1993); Clark and Weir (1999)) or partial predicateargument structure (e.g., Abney (1996)) as steps in the direction of open knowledge extraction, though typically few of the tuples obtained (often a type of subject plus a verb, or a verb plus a type of object) can be interpreted as complete items of world knowledge.

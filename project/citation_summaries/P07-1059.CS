Similar work has also been performed in the area of query expansion using training data consisting of FAQ pages (Riezler et al., 2007) or queries and clicked snippets from query logs (Riezler et al., 2008). 
Several solutions to this problem have been proposed including query expansion (Riezler et al., 2007; Fang, 2008), query reformulation or paraphrasing (Hermjakob et al., 2002; Tomuro, 2003; Zukerman and Raskutti, 2002) and semantic information retrieval (Muller et al., 2007). 
In practice, training data for translation-based retrieval often consist in question-answer pairs, usually extracted from the evaluation corpus itself (Riezler et al., 2007; Xue et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008). 
One way to address this problem is to learn question-to-answer transformations using a translation model (Berger et al., 2000; Echihabi and Marcu, 2003; Soricut and Brill, 2006; Riezler et al., 2007). 
Recently (Riezler et al., 2007) used statistical machine translation for query expansion and took a step towards bridging the lexical gap between questions and answers.

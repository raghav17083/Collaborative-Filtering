In information retrieval, the problem of predicting system performance has generated considerable interest and has led to notably good results (Cronen-Townsend et al., 2002; Yom-Tov et al., 2005; Carmel et al., 2006). 
Repetition in the input is often exploited as an indicator of importance by different summarization approaches (Luhn, 1958; Barzilay et al., 1999; Radev et al., 2004; Nenkova et al., 2006). 
4.3 Use of topic words in the summary Summarization systems that directly optimize for more topic signatures during content selection have fared very well in evaluations (Conroy et al., 2006). 
In information retrieval, for example, the variable system performance has been recognized as a research challenge and numerous studies on identifying query difficulty have been carried out (most recently (Cronen-Townsend et al., 2002; Yom-Tov et al., 2005; Carmel et al., 2006)). 
2 NP-rewrite enhanced frequency summarizer Frequency and frequency-related measures of importance have been traditionally used in text summarization as indicators of importance (Luhn, 1958; Lin and Hovy, 2000; Conroy et al., 2006).

Recently, many phrase reordering methods have been proposed, ranging from simple distancebased distortion model (Koehn  et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), flat reordering model (Wu, 1997; Zens et al., 2004), lexicalized reordering model (Tillmann, 2004; Kumar and Byrne, 2005), to hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005; Setiawan et al., 2007) and classifier-based reordering model with linear features (Zens and Ney, 2006; Xiong et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007a; Xiong et al., 2008). 
3 The Transducer Translation Model The Transducer Translation Model (TTM) (Kumar and Byrne, 2005; Kumar et al., 2006) is a generative model of translation that applies a series of transformations specified by conditional probability distributions and encoded as Weighted Finite State Transducers (Mohri et al., 2002). 
In this local re-ordering model (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005; Kumar and Byrne, 2005) a block a0 with orientation a1 is generated relative to its predecessor block a0a3a2. 
Kumar and Byrne (2005) define two local reordering models for their Translation Template Model (TTM): In the first one, called MJ-1, only adjacent phrases are allowed to swap, and the movement has to be done within a window of 2. 
1 Introduction The Cambridge University Engineering Department statistical machine translation system follows the Transducer Translation Model (Kumar and Byrne, 2005; Kumar et al., 2006), a phrase-based generative model of translation that applies a series of transformations specified by conditional probability distributions and encoded as Weighted Finite State Transducers (Mohri et al., 2002).

Other attempts in 1006 this vein include mappings between WordNet and PropBank (Palmer et al. , 2004) and mappings to Levin classes (Levin, 1993; Palmer et al. , 2005). 
These groupings were previously shown to reconcile a substantial portion of the tagging disagreements, raising inter-annotator agreement from 71% in the case of fine-grained WordNet senses to 82% in the case of grouped senses for the Senseval 2 English data (Palmer et al. , to appear), and currently to 89% for 93 new verbs (almost 12K instances) (Palmer et al. , 2004). 
Several researchers (e.g., (Palmer et al., 2004; Navigli, 2006; Snow et al., 2007; Hovy et al., 2006)) work on reducing the granularity of sense inventories for WSD. 
7 Related and Future Work PropBank I (Palmer et al. , 2005), developed at UPenn, captures predicate argument structure for verbs; NomBank provides predicate argument structure for nominalizations and other noun predicates (Meyers et al. , 2004). 
A wide variety of semantic and syntactic criteria were used to produce the SENSEVAL-2 groupings (Palmer et al. , 2004; Palmer et al. , 2005); this data covers all senses of 411 nouns, 519 verbs, and 257 adjectives, and has been used as gold standard sense clustering data in previous work (Agirre and Lopez, 2003; McCarthy, 2006)2.

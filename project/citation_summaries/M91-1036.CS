Recent methods for automatic recognition of discourse structure from text have incorporated thesaurus-based and other information retrieval techniques to identify changes in topic (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Yarowsky, 1991; Iwafiska et al. , 1991; Hearst, 1994; Reynar, 1994). 
IA clause in this case is delimited in much the same way as in Hobbs et al's terminal substring parser (Hobbs et al. , 1991), i.e. by commas, relative pronouns, some conjunctions and some forms of that. 
Introduction One of the issues to emerge from recent evaluations of information extraction systems (Sundheim, 1992) is the importance of discourse processing (Iwafiska et al. , 1991) and, in particular, the ability to recognise multiple events in a text. 
A probabilistic part-of-speech tagger (POST) \[Meteer, et al. , 1991\] which assumed a single sequence of words as input. 
Although more exotic forms of event recognition exist at varying levels of analysis (such as within the abductive reasoning mechanism of SRI's TACITUS system (Hobbs et al. , 1991), in a thesaurus-based lexical cohesion algorithm (Morris and Hirst, 1991) and in a semantic network (Kozima, 1993)), template merging is the most used method.

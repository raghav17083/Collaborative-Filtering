This is in contrast to supervised word segmentation algorithms (e.g., Teahan et al., 2000), which are typically used for segmenting text in documents written in languages that do not put spaces between their words like Chinese. 
Conventionally, there are four approaches to develop a CWS: (1) Dictionary-based approach (Cheng et al. 1999), especial forward and backward maximum matching (Wong and Chan, 1996); (2) Linguistic approach based on syntax-semantic knowledge (Chen et al. 2002); (3) Statistical approach based on statistical language model (SLM) (Sproat and Shih, 1990; Teahan et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2003); and (4) Hybrid approach trying to combine the benefits of dictionary-based, linguistic and statistical approaches (Tsai et al. 2003; Ma and Chen, 2003). 
For example, the N-gram generative language modeling based approach of Teahan et al (2000) does not use domain knowledge. 
There are also many relevant research on Chinese word segmentation (Teahan et al., 2000; Peng and Schuurmans, 2001; Xu et al., 2008).

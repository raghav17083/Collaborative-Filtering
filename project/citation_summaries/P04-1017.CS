Although the centering theory has been considered as a critical theory and the driving force behind the coreferential phenomena since its proposal, its application in coreference resolution (in particular pronoun resolution) has been somewhat disappointing: it fails to improve or even harms the performance of the state-of987  the-art coreference resolution systems in previous research (e.g. Yang et al. 2004). 
These features are calculated by mining the parse trees, and then could be used for resolution by using manually designed rules (Lappin and Leass, 1994; Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996; Mitkov, 1998), or using machine-learning methods (Aone and Bennett, 1995; Yang et al. , 2004; Luo and Zitouni, 2005). 
Different from (Luo et al., 2004), the entitylevel features are computed using a Most-X strategy, that is, two given entities would have a feature X, if most of the mention pairs from the two entities have the feature X. Yang et al. 
This supports the claims in (Yang et al., 2004a) that coreferential information is an important factor to evaluate a candidate antecedent in pronoun resolution. 
It has appeared under a number of names: success (Yang et al., 2006), accuracy (Kehler et al., 2004a; Angheluta et al., 2004) and success rate (Tetreault, 2001).

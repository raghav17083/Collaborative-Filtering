These words are called hapax legomena and known to have similar characteristics to real unknown words (Baayen and Sproat, 1996). 
We will not discuss this further here, but see Baayen and Sproat (1996) for discussion of the related phenomenon of ambiguous derivational affixes. 
It is well known that the characteristics of hapax legomena are similar to those of unknown words (Baayen and Sproat, 1996). 
For instance, Baayen (1989, 1992) and Baayen and Renouf (1996) exploit the Good-Turing estimate for the probability of sampling unseen types (Good 1953) to develop measures for the degree of productivity of affixes, Baayen and Sproat (to appear) apply this Good-Turing estimate to obtain enhanced estimates of lexical priors for unseen words, and the Good-Turing estimates also play an important role for estimating population probabilities (Church and Gale 1991). 
Baayen and Sproat (1996) proposed that the characteristics of infrequent words in a training corpus resemble those of unknown words.

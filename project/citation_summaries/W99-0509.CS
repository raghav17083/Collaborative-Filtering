The methodology and implementation of word sense disambiguation is fully discussed in Viegas, Jin and Beale(1999a: 1999b, 1999c).


Over the years, various methodologies have been investigated carrying out the structure of a computational lexicon entry within a knowledge-based framework(Onyshkevych et aI, 1995; Viegas and Raskin, 1998; Viegas: 1999; Viegas, et a/, 1998a, 1998b).

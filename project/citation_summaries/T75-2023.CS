THE REASONER AND THE INFERENCER DON'T TALK MUCH TO EACH OTHER Robert P. Abelson Yale University In this paper, I wish to point out an important problem which has largely escaped notice in the field(s) of natural language processing~ Curiously, it is implicit in the topic title of this session, "Reasoning and Inference"~ The fact that two terms were used in the title instead of one implies a meaningful distinction between two different types of intelligent processing~ The dictionary definitions of reasoning and inference are not much help in making a sharp distinction, but in actual use in artificial intelligence work these are two quite different traditions, each laying claim to one of the terms~ Reasoning refers to the processing of abstract propositions to reach abstract conclusions~ Reasoning is formal; it is based on the use of logical or mathematical rules, or special devices in a particular problem-solving domain~ Inferencing, on the other hand, refers to the processing of concrete facts to reach concrete conclusions~ It is informal and "common-sensical" (whatever we quite mean by that)~ It includes the curren~ vein of work on "frames" (Minsky, 1974; Winograd, 1975) or "scripts" (Schank & Abelson, 1975) or "conceptual overlays" (Rieger, 1975a) in which input patterns are matched to big memory structures from which further expectations are read out~ It is conceivable that one of these two approaches is "right" and the other "wrong".

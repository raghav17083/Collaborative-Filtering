The Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1994) has more than a hundred phrase labels, and a number of empty categories, but uses a coarser tagset. 
The Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) was initially used to extract complement-taking nouns. 
In this study we use PropBanked versions of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1994) and part of the Brown portion of the Penn Treebank. 
Manually defined heuristics are used to automatically annotate each tree in the treebank with partially specified HPSG derivation trees: Head/argument/modifier distinctions are made for each node in the tree based on Magerman (1994) and Collins (1997); 336 ODonovan et al. Large-Scale Induction and Evaluation of Lexical Resources the whole tree is then converted to a binary tree; heuristics are applied to deal with phenomena such as LDDs and coordination and to correct some errors in the treebank, and finally an HPSG category is assigned to each node in the tree in accordance with its CFG category. 
In this paper we report on a particular experience of automatic extraction of an English grammar from the WSJ corpus of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al. , 1994)1 using Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAGs, (Joshi and Schabes, 1997)).

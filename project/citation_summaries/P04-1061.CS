Bod (2006) reports 82.9% unlabeled f-score on the same WSJ10 as used by Klein and Manning (2002, 2004). 
Dependency Model with Valence (DMV) by Klein and Manning (2004). 
Recent work has successfully induced unlabeled grammatical structure, but has not successfully learned labeled tree structure (Klein and Manning, 2002; Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2004). 
We can compute the probability of T as follows: () ()  =  = = N i ii N GGSGP SGGGP STP 1 11 21,,,| |,,, | Following (Klein and Manning, 2004), we require that the creation of a dependency link from head h to modifier m be preceded by placing a left STOP and a right STOP around the modifier m and STOP between h and m. Let L w E (and R w E ) denote the event that there are no more modifiers on the left (and right) of a word w. Suppose the dependency link created in the step i is (u, v, d). 
We simply perform supervised training with this subset, which is still quite noisy (4), and performance quickly 6While these results are worse than those obtained previously for this model, the experiments in Klein and Manning (2004) and only used sentences of 10 words or fewer, without punctuation, and with gold-standard tags.

(2008) comparably evaluated a number of kernels for incorporating syntactic features, including the bag-of-word kernel, the subset tree kernel (Moschitti, 2006) and the graph kernel (Airola et al., 2008), and they concluded that combining all kernels achieved better results than using any individual one.

For example, Malouf (2000) has shown that large corpora can be used to determine the order of realization of sequences of prenominal adjectives. 
The third advantage is that the combined usage of graphs and cost-functions paves the way for a natural integration of traditional rule-based approaches to generation with more recent statistical approaches (e.g. , Langkilde & Knight 1998, Malouf 2000) in a single algorithm. 
Malouf (2000) continues this work, determining the order for sequences of prenominal adjectives by examining several different statistical and machine learning techniques. 
(4) The combined use of graphs and cost functions paves the way for a natural integration of traditional rule-based approaches to generating referring expressions and more recent statistical approaches, such as Langkilde and Knight (1998) and Malouf (2000), in a single algorithm. 
To compensate for this, Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou (1999) propose to compute the transitive closure of the ordering relation: if a c and c b, then a b. Malouf (2000) further proposes a back-off bigram model of adjective pairs for choosing among alternative orders (P(ha;bijfa;bg) vs. P(hb;aijfa;bg)).

Zechner and Bejar (Zechner and Bejar, 2006) presented a system to score non-native spontaneous speech using features derived from the recognition results. 
While previous tests of spoken language have focused mainly on either high or low entropy tasks (Bernstein, 1999; Zechner and Bejar, 2006), we have made an attempt at starting to address the whole scale of entropy within a single test. 
Zechner and Bejar (2006) investigate the automated scoring of unrestricted, spontaneous speech of non-native speakers. 
Therefore, unlike in other systems focusing either on high or low entropy speech (e.g., Zechner and Bejar, 2006; Bernstein, 1999), in which a single speech recognizer is employed, it is anticipated that different types of speech recognizers are needed to suit different THT task types. 
1 Introduction As demand for spoken language testing and cost of human scoring have increased in recent years, there is a growing interest in building both research and industrial systems for automatically scoring non-native speech (Bernstein, 1999, Zechner and Bejar, 2006, Zechner et al, 2007).

Such approaches work well in situations where large labeled corpora are available for training and validation (e.g., movie reviews), but they do not perform well when training data is scarce or when it comes from a different domain (Aue and Gamon, 2005; Read, 2005), topic (Read, 2005) or time period (Read, 2005). 
(2002), various classification models and linguistic features have been proposed to improve the classification performance (Pang and Lee, 2004; Mullen and Collier, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005; Read, 2005). 
Read (2005) also observed significant differences between the accuracy of classification of reviews in the same domain but published in different time periods.

The cost of manual taggingalsoaddstotheproblem.Reusingthesame corpus for training classifiers for new domains is also not effective: several studies report decreased accuracy in cross-domain classification (Engstrm, 2004; Aue & Gamon, 2005) a similar problem has also been observed in classification of documents createdoverdifferenttimeperiods(Read,2005).

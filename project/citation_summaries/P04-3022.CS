Kambhatla (2004) employed maximum entropy models with features derived from word, entity type, mention level, overlap, dependency tree, parse tree and achieved Fmeasure of 52.8 on the 24 relation subtypes in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus. 
For the feature-based methods, Kambhatla (2004) employed Maximum Entropy models to combine diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic features in relation extraction, and achieved the F-measure of 52.8 on the 24 relation subtypes in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus. 
This paper focuses on the ACE RDC subtask, where many machine learning methods have been proposed, including supervised methods (Miller et al., 2000; Zelenko et al., 2002; Culotta and Soresen, 2004; Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006; Qian et al., 2008), semi-supervised methods (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zhang, 2004; Chen et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2008), and unsupervised methods (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005).

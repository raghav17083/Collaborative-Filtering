PROVERB combines both of these approaches in a uniform planning framework (Huang, 1994a).


Figure 1 shows the architecture of PROVERB(Huang, 1994a; HuangFiedler, 1997): the macroplanner produces a sequence of PCAs, the DRCC (Derive Reference Choices Component) module of the microplanner enriches the PCAs with reference choices.

wi  B and wj  E: cell is not closed, i.e., it is open In Roark and Hollingshead (2008), we proved that, for the CYK algorithm, there is no work necessary for case 1 cells, a constant amount of work for case 2 cells, and a linear amount of work for case 3 cells. 
c 2009 Association for Computational Linguistics Linear Complexity Context-Free Parsing Pipelines via Chart Constraints Brian Roark and Kristy Hollingshead Center for Spoken Language Understanding Division of Biomedical Computer Science Oregon Health & Science University {roark,hollingk}@cslu.ogi.edu Abstract In this paper, we extend methods from Roark and Hollingshead (2008) for reducing the worst-case complexity of a context-free parsing pipeline via hard constraints derived from finite-state tagging pre-processing. 
In contrast, in Roark andHollingshead(2008),wederivedandappliedthe finite-state constraints so as to guarantee a reduction in the worst-case complexity of the context-free parsing pipeline from O(N3) in the length of the string N to O(N2) by closing chart cells to entries. 
We begin with a summary of the chart cell constraint techniques from Roark and Hollingshead (2008), and some initial empirical trials applying these techniques to an exact inference CYK parser.

For instance, when building translation units in EBMT approaches (Richardson et al. , 2001), (Aramaki, 2001), (AlAdhaileh &Tang, 1999), (Sato & Nagao, 1990), (Sato, 1991), (Sadler & Vendelmans, 1990), etc. , where S-SSTC can be used to represent the entries of the BKB or when S-SSTC used as an annotation schema to find the translation correspondences (lexical and structural correspondences) for transferrules extraction from parallel parsed corpus (Menezes & Richardson, 2001), (Watanabe et al. , Tree String Tree String Figure 9: Partial subtree/s correspondence: the German sentence Er beschenkte Hans reichlich and its corresponding English sentence He gave John an expensive present; i.e. the use of (-) operation to calculate the Y:STREE interval. 
5 Related Work The idea of example based machine translation systems was first proposed by (Nagao, 1984), and preliminary systems that appeared about ten years (Sato and Nagao, 1990; Sadler and Vendelmans, 1990; Maruyama and Watanabe, 1992; Furuse and Iida, 1994) showed the basic feasibility of the idea. 
It is interesting to constrast this method with the "parse-parse-match" approaches that have been reported recently for producing parallel bracketed corpora (Sadler & Vendelmans 1990; Kaji et al. 1992; Matsumoto et al. 1993; Cranias et al. 1994; Gfishman 1994). 
Structured bilingual or multilingual corpora serve as richer sonrces for extracting linguistic knowledge (Klavans and Tzonkermann, 1990; Sadler and Vendelmans, 1990; Kaji, Kida attd Morimoto, 1992; Utsuro, Matsnmoto and Nagao, 1992; Matsumoto, l.shimoto and Utsuro, 1993; Utsuro, Matsumoto and Nagao, 1993). 
Proposals have been put forward, e.g., by Sadler and Vendelmans (1990) and Kaji et al.

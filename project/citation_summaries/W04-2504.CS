Exploiting (immediate) dialogue context: previous system answer Whereas the role of the system answer has been ignored in some previous accounts of FU Qs (e.g., (Chai and Jin, 2004) and even in the highly influential TREC task (Voorhees, 2004)), our data suggest that the system answer does play a role for predicting what a FU Q will focus on: it seems that the system answer can introduce entities that a salient FU Q will ask more information about. 
There is a topic shift, as defined by Chai and Jin (2004), where the main topic becomes an entity related to the entity the preceding question was about. 
Furthermore, our empirical investigation shows that it suffices to consider a rather short history of the dialogue, i.e. the previous user question and previous system answer, when looking for relations between previous dialogue and a FU Q. Salient transitions between two consecutive questions are defined in (Chai and Jin, 2004) under the name of informational transitions. 
from task to related entity: entity is a semantic argument of the task 2Comparing our points to (Chai and Jin, 2004), Topic zoom: 1. 
Discourse processing could further enhance question answering systems by interpreting the users question either in isolation or in the context of preceding questions (Chai and Jing, 2004).

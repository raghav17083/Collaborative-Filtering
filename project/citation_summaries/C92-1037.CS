It is important for my claim to have preserved compositionality that all the analyses in this paper have been obtained on the basis of the interpretations of the lexical items that appear in them and the semantics of the rules of combination, using a version of the system described in (Ramsay, 1992; Ramsay and Sch/~ler, 1995).

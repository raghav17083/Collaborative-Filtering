In machine learning work on lemmatization for highly inflective languages, it is most often assumed that a word form and a POS tag are given, and the task is to predict the set of corresponding lemma(s) (Mooney and Califf, 1995; Clark, 2002; Wicentowski, 2002; Erjavec and Dzeroski, 2004; Dreyer et al., 2008).

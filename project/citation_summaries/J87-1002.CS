7.2 Argument Understanding Systems Several researchers have built argument understanding systems, but none has addressed participants coming to an agreement or mutual belief about a particular situation, either because the researchers investigated monologues only (Cohen 1987; Cohen and Young 1991), or because they assumed that dialogue participants do not change 28 In a dialogue, Grosz and Sidner's discourse segment purpose is intended to capture the purpose of a segment consisting of a series of utterances by both participants, not the communicative intentions underlying each participant's discourse actions. 
This differentiates collaborative negotiation from argumentation (Birnbaum et al. , 1980; Reichman, 1981; Cohen, 1987; Quilici, 1992). 
However, Cohen analyzed argumentative texts and found variation in the order in which claims and their evidence are presented (Cohen 1987). 
A number of researchers (Reichman 1978, 1985; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Polanyi 1986; Cohen 1987; Hirschberg and Litman 1987; Litman and Allen 1987; Schiffrin 1987; Hinkelman 1989; Litman and Hirschberg 1990; Knott and Dale 1994; Knott and Mellish 1996; Marcu 1997) have investigated the use in discourse of special words and phrases such as but, anyway, and by the way. 
This feature differentiates collaborative negotiation from argumentation (Birnbaum, Flowers, and McGuire 1980; Reichman 1981; Flowers and Dyer 1984; Cohen 1987; Quilici 1992).

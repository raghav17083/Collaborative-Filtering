Over the last decade, (Dale, 1989, Dale, Haddock, 1991, Reiter, 1990b, Dale, Reiter, 1995), and others 2 have contributed to this issue The term 'referential description' is due to Donellan (Donellan, 1966). 
We focus here on the following algorithms:  The Full Brevity algorithm (Dale, 1989) attempts to build a minimal distinguishing description by always selecting the most discriminatory property available; see Algorithm 1. 
Building upon Dale and Reiters work (Dale, 1989; Dale and Reiter, 1995), various researchers have added extensions such as reference to sets (Stone, 2000), more expressive logical connectives (van Deemter, 2002), and relational expressions (Dale and Haddock, 1991). 
Two other interpretations, the Greedy heuristic interpretation (Dale, 1989) and the local brevity interpretation (Reiter, 1990a) lead to algorithms that have polynomial complexity in the same order of magnitude.

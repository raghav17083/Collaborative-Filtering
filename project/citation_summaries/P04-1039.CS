This includes the automatic generation of sense-tagged data using monosemous relatives (Leacock et al. , 1998; Mihalcea and Moldovan, 1999; Agirre and Martinez, 2004), automatically bootstrapped disambiguation patterns (Yarowsky, 1995; Mihalcea, 2002), parallel texts as a way to point out word senses bearing different translations in a second language (Diab and Resnik, 2002; Ng et al. , 2003; Diab, 2004), and the use of volunteer contributions over the Web (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002). 
However, most of previous research has focused on using multilingual resources typically used in SMT systems to improve WSD accuracy, e.g., DaganandItai(1994), LiandLi(2002), 63 Diab (2004). 
Other work includes Li and Li (2002) who propose a bilingual bootstrapping method to learn a translation disambiguation WSD model, and Diab (2004) who exploited large amounts of automatically generated noisy parallel data to learn WSD models in an unsupervised bootstrapping scheme. 
Starting with a collection of parallel texts, sense annotations were generated either for one word at a time (Ng et al. , 2003; Diab, 2004), or for all words in unrestricted text (Diab and Resnik, 2002), and in both cases the systems trained on these data were found to be competitive with other word sense disambiguation systems. 
(2003), and Diab (2003, 2004a, and 2004b) made research on the use of alignment for WSD.

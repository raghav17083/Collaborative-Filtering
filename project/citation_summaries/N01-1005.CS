Different models, such as Support Vector Machine (Shen and Klakow, 2006) and Maximum Entropy Model (Ittycheriah et al., 2001), are used to integrate sophisticated linguistic features to determine the correctness of candidates. 
Many previous approaches to answer typing, e.g., (Ittycheriah et al. , 2001; Li and Roth, 2002; Krishnan et al. , 2005), employ a predefined set of answer types and use supervised learning or manually constructed rules to classify a question according to expected answer type. 
The IBM PIQUANT system (Carroll et al. , 2002) combines knowledge-based agents using predictive annotation with a statistical approach based on a maximum entropy model (Ittycheriah et al. , 2001). 
3.2 Statistical Answering Agent The second answering agent takes a statistical approach to question answering (Ittycheriah, 2001; Ittycheriah et al. , 2001). 
4 Maximum Entropy Training For these experiments we use the Maximum Entropy formulation (Della Pietra et al. , 1995) and model the distribution (Ittycheriah, 2001b), a12a14a13a16a15a18a17a19a21a20a23a22a25a24a27a26a29a28a31a30a21a12a14a13a16a15a18a17a32a18a20a33a19a21a20a34a22a25a24a35a12a14a13a36a32a21a17a19a21a20a33a22a25a24 (1) The patterns derived above are used as features to model the distribution a37a39a38a41a40a43a42a44a46a45a48a47a49a45a48a50a52a51, which predicts the correctness of the configuration of the question, a47, the predicted answer tag, a44, and the answer candidate, a50 . The training data for the algorithm consists of TREC-8, TREC-9, and a subset of the KM questions which have been judged to have answers in the TREC corpus5.

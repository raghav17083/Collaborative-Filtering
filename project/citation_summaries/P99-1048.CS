For the statistics-based approaches, Bean and Riloff (1999) developed a statistics-based method for automatically identifying existential definite NPs which are non-anaphoric. 
More recently, the problem has been tackled using statistics-based (e.g., Bean and Riloff 1999; Bergsma et al 2008) and learning-based (e.g. Evans 2001; Ng and Cardie 2002a; Ng 2004; Yang et al 2005; Denis and Balbridge 2007) methods. 
First, a non-anaphoric NP classifier identifies definite noun phrases that are existential, using both syntactic rules and our learned existential NP recognizer (Bean and Riloff, 1999), and removes them from the resolution process. 
(2008)]), and others identifying non-anaphoric definite descriptions (using rule-based techniques [e.g., Vieira and Poesio (2000)] and unsupervised techniques [e.g., Bean and Riloff (1999)]). 
2 Related Work Given its potential usefulness in coreference resolution, anaphoricity determination has been studied fairly extensively in the literature and can be classified into three categories: heuristic rule-based (e.g. Paice and Husk 1987; Lappin and Leass 1994; Kennedy and Boguraev 1996; Denber 1998; Vieira and Poesio 2000), statistics-based (e.g., Bean and Riloff 1999; Cherry and Bergsma 2005; Bergsma et al 2008) and learning-based (e.g. Evans 2001; Ng and Cardie 2002a; Ng 2004; Yang et al 2005; Denis and Balbridge 2007).

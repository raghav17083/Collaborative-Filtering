Experiment In our experiment, we used domain-specific Japanese documents within the medical domain (225,402 sentences, 10,144 pages, 37MB) gathered from the Web pages of a medical school and the 2005 Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus 1 . Recently, there has been a study on query expansion with this thesaurus as domain information (Friberg 2007).

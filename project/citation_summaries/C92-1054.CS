Future work must examine the interaction between centering and discourse segmentation in both monologue and dialogue (Whittaker and Stenton 1988; Walker and Whittaker 1990; Walker 1993b), and the role of deictics, lexical semantics, one anaphora, and propositional discourse entities in centering (Webber 1978; Sidner 1979; Walker 1992, 1993a; Cote 1995). 
Determine-Acceptance follows Walker's weakest link assumption (Walker 1992) and computes the strength of the evidence as the weaker of the strengths of the antecedent belief and the evidential relationship. 
4.2 Modifying Unaccepted Proposals The collaborative planning principle in (Whittak~ and Stenton, 1988; Walker, 1992) suggests that "conversants must provide evidence of a detected discrepancy in belief as soon as possible". 
It can be further classified into two groups: repetitions, a subset of the informationally redundant utterances (Walker, 1992), in which the speaker paraphrases an utterance by the hearer or repeats the utterance verbatim, and prompts, in which the speaker merely acknowledges the bearer's previous utterance(s). 
Introduction 1.1 Centering in Japanese Discourse Recently there has been an increasing amount of work in computational linguistics involving the interpretation of anaphoric elements in Japanese (Yoshimoto 1988; Kuno 1989; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1990; Nakagawa 1992).

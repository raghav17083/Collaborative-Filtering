There is a constraint on the use of gaps in rewriting called the bracketing constraint, for which we refer to F. Pereira (1981). 
In natural language processing, useful grammar formalisms have been developed and incorporated in Prolog: metamorphosis grammars, due to Colmerauer (1978), and extraposition grammars, defined by F. Pereira (1981); definite clause grammars (Pereira and Warren 1980) are a special case of metamorphosis grammars.

A number of nonconcatenative grammar formalisms has been put forward, such as head-wrapping grammars (HG) (Pollard, 1984), extraposition grammars (XG) (Pereira, 1981). 
In fact, the treatment of extraposition in MSGs is based on F. Pereira's (1981) extraposition grammars (XGs), and MSGs can be compiled into XGs (which in turn can be compiled into Horn clause systems).

Among the attempts to enrich lexical information, many have been directed to the analysis of dictionary definitions and the transformation of the implicit information to explicit knowledge bases for computational purposes (Amsler, 1981; Calzolari, 1984; Chodorow et al., 1985; Markowitz et al., 1986; Klavans et al., 1990; Vossen and Copestake, 1993). 
DAM is completely described in Byrd, et al.(1986b). 
The recognized necessity to describe the concept lexicon prior to dealing with natural languages is a feature which clearly distinguishes our approach from Computational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1987 277 Sergei Nirenburg and Victor Raskin The Subworld Concept Lexicon and the Lexicon Management System other work on lexical aids (e.g. , Ahlswede 1985) and brings us closer to some non-NL work on knowledge acquisition (e.g. , Lenat et al. 1986). 
Many attempts have also been made to transform the implicit information in dictionary definitions to explicit knowledge bases for computational purposes (Amsler, 1981; Calzolaxi, 1984; Chodorow et al. , 1985; Maxkowitz et al. , 1986; Klavans et al. , 1990; Vossen and Copestake, 1993). 
Individual tools and their use in that project have been described elsewhere (Chodorow, et a1.(1985), Byrd and Chodorow(1985), Byrd, et al.(1986b), Chodorow and Ravin(1987), Neff and Byrd(1987)).

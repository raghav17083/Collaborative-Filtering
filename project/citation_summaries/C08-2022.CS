7 Automated Sense Labelling of Discourse Connectives The focus here is on automated sense labelling of discourse connectives (Elwell and Baldridge, 2008; Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Pitler et al., 2009; Wellner and Pustejovsky, 2007; Wellner, 679 Total Density of Intra-Sentential Intra-Sentential Total Intra-Sentential Intra-Sentential Subordinating Coordinating Discourse Genre Sentences Connectives Connectives/Sentence Conjunctions Conjunctions Adverbials ESSAYS 4774 1397 0.293 808 (57.8%) 438 (31.4%) 151 (10.8%) SUMMARIES 2118 275 0.130 166 (60.4%) 99 (36.0%) 10 (3.6%) LETTERS 739 200 0.271 126 (63.0%) 56 (28.0%) 18 (9.0%) NEWS 40095 9336 0.233 5514 (59.1%) 3015 (32.3%) 807 (8.6%) Figure 4: Distribution of Explicit Intra-Sentential Connectives. 
Explicit relations are much easier (Pitler et al., 2008). 
6 Connective Sense by Genre (Pitler et al., 2008) show a difference across Level 1 senses (COMPARISON, CONTINGENCY, TEMPORAL and EXPANSION) in the PDTB in terms of their tendency to be realised by explicit connectives (a tendency of COMPARISON and TEMPORAL relations) or by Implicit Connectives (a tendency of CONTINGENCY and EXPANSION). 
The most general senses (comparison, contingency, temporal and expansion) can be disambiguated in explicit relations with 93% accuracy based solely on the discourse connective used to signal the relation (Pitler et al., 2008). 
When there is a discourse connective (e.g., because) between two text spans, it is often easy to recognize the relation between the spans, as most connectives are unambiguous (Miltsakaki et al., 2005; Pitler et al., 2008).

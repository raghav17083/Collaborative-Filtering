This testgrammar is based on the implementation of an analysis of partial vP topicalization in German (Hinrichs et al. , 1994) in the Troll system (Gerdemann and King, 1994). 
We omit the details, since we want to keep the definition of the default operation as general as possible, and there are a number of different constraint languages within feature structure frameworks (e.g. , Alshawi et al. 1991; 70 Lascarides and Copestake Default Representation Carpenter 1992; D6rre and Eisle 1991; Emele and Zajac 1990; Gerdemann and King 1994; Krieger and Sch/ifer 1994; de Paiva 1993; Smolka 1989). 
The practical effect of this is that Troll implements an exhaustive typing strategy which provides the stronger kind of inferencing over descriptions (Gerdemann and King, 1993, 1994) required by standard HPSG theories.

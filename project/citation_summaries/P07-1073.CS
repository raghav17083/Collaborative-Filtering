Bunescu and Mooney (2007) presented an approach to extract relations from the Web using minimal supervision. 
In this section, we show that many relationships are consistently expressed using a compactsetofrelation-independentlexico-syntacticpatterns, and quantify their frequency based on a sample of 500 sentences selected at random from an IE trainingcorpusdevelopedby(BunescuandMooney, 2007).1 This observation helps to explain the success of open relation extraction, which learns a relation-independent extraction model as described in Section 3.1. 
Notable exceptions include Rosario and Hearst (2005) and Bunescu and Mooney (2007), who tackle relation classification and extraction tasks by considering the set of contexts in which the members of a candidate relation argument pair co-occur. 
One means of combating this is suggested by (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007). 
Other types of relations that have been studied by pattern-based approaches include questionanswer relations (such as birthdates and inventor) (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), synonyms and antonyms (Lin et al., 2003), general purpose analogy (Turney et al., 2003), verb relations (including similarity, strength, antonym, enablement and temporal) (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), entailment (Szpektor et al., 2004), and more specific relations, such as purpose, creation (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007), LivesIn, and EmployedBy (Bunescu and Mooney , 2007).

The similar conclusion also holds for speech summarization on English sources (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2006).


(Maskey and Hirschberg, 2006) focuses on how to use acoustic information alone to help predict sentences to be included in a summary and shows a novel way of using continuous HMMs for summarizing speech documents without transcriptions.


Alternatively, some methods which are independent of lexical features are presented (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2003; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2006).


Considering the difficulty in obtaining high quality transcriptions, some researchers proposed speech summarization systems with non-lexical features (Inoue et al. , 2004; Koumpis and Renals, 2005; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2003; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2006).


Supervised methods include hidden Markov model (HMM), maximum entropy, conditional random fields (CRF), and support vector machines (SVM) (Galley, 2006; Buist et al., 2005; Xie et al., 2008; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2006).

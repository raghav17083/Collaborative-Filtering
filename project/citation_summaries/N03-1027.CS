In such cases, we must take steps to adapt a model trained on the source domain for use in the target domain (Roark and Bacchiani, 2003; Florian et al. , 2004; Chelba and Acero, 2004; Ando, 2004; Lease and Charniak, 2005; Daume III and Marcu, 2006). 
The best statistical parsers have shown good results on this benchmark, but these statistical parsers demonstrate far worse results when they are applied to data from a different domain (Roark and Bacchiani, 2003; Gildea, 2001; Ratnaparkhi, 1999). 
Roark and Bacchiani (2003) use a Dirichlet prior on the multinomial parameters of a generative parsing model to combine a large amount of training data from a source corpus (WSJ), and small amount of training data from a target corpus (Brown). 
Roark and Bacchiani (2003) showed that weighted count-merging is a special case of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, and successfully used it for probabilistic context-free grammar domain adaptation (Roark and Bacchiani, 2003) and language model adaptation (Bacchiani and Roark, 2003). 
Previous work (Roark and Bacchiani, 2003) has shown that better accuracy can be achieved by finding the optimal re-weighting between these two datasets, but this issue is orthogonal to our method, so we only consider equal weighting.

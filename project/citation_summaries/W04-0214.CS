the XLE system (Kaplan et al. , 2004)) because there is insufficient training data and it is as yet unclear how such as model would perform at the detailed level of semantic representation produced by the TRIPS parser (see Figure 2 and discussion below). 
4 Experiments The Monroe domain (Tetreault et al. , 2004; Stent, 2001) is a series of task-oriented dialogues between human participants set in a simulated rescue operation domain, where participants collaboratively plan responses to emergency calls. 
3 Evaluation Our evaluation data is an excerpt from the Monroe corpus that has been used in previous TRIPS research on parsing speed and accuracy (Swift et al. , 2004). 
The grammar is fairly extensive in coverage (and still growing), and has quite good coverage of a corpus of humanhuman dialogs in the Monroe domain, an emergency management domain (Swift et al. , 2004). 
Since our motivation for unification parsing is to reveal semantics as well as syntax, we next evaluated Aug-TRIPSs production of correct interpretations at the sentence level, which require complete correctness not only of the bracketing structure but of the sense chosen for each word and the thematic 198 roles of each argument (Tetreault et al. , 2004).

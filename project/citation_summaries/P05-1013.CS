2 A shift-reduce parsing framework for dependency DAGs One of the key assumptions in both graph-based (McDonald et al., 2005) and transition-based (Nivre, 2004; Nivre and Nilsson, 2006) approaches to data-driven dependency parsing is that the dependency structure produced by the parser is a tree, where each word has exactly one head (except for a single root word, which has no head in the sentence). 
The pseudo-projective transformation proposed by Nivre and Nilsson (2005) is such an approach, which is compatible with different parser engines. 
4.3 Experiment 3: Optimization In this section we combine the best results from the previous section with the graph transformations proposed by Nivre and Nilsson (2005) to recover non-projective dependencies. 
Most of this work has so far focused either on post-processing to recover non-local dependencies from context-free parse trees (Johnson, 2002; Jijkoun and De Rijke, 2004; Levy and Manning, 2004; Campbell, 2004), or on incorporating nonlocal dependency information in nonterminal categories in constituency representations (Dienes and Dubey, 2003; Hockenmaier, 2003; Cahill et al. , 2004) or in the categories used to label arcs in dependency representations (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005). 
4.3 Related Work Recent work by Nivre and Nilsson introduces a technique where the projectivization transformation is encoded in the non-terminals of constituents during parsing (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005).

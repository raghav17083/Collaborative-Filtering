More recently, EM has been used to learn hidden variables in parse trees; these can be head-childannotations(ChiangandBikel, 2002), latent head features (Matsuzaki et al. , 2005; Prescher, 2005; Dreyer and Eisner, 2006), or hierarchicallysplit nonterminal states (Petrov et al. , 2006).

It thus complements and extends the approach of Chiang and Bikel (2002), who aim at discovering latent head markers in tree-banks to improve manually written head-percolation rules. 
The bestreported F1 constituency scores from this work for each language are 79.9% (Chinese (Chiang and Bikel, 2002)), 81.0% (French (Arun and Keller, 2005), 76.2% (German (Dubey, 2005)), and 73.8% (Spanish (Moreno et al. , 2000)).

The second and more closely related class deals with extracting specific facts such as birthplace, occupation, etc. For this task, the primary theme of work in the literature has been to treat the task as a general semantic-class learning problem where one starts with a few seeds of the semantic relationship of interest and learns contextual patterns such as <NAME> was born in <Birthplace> or <NAME> (born <Birthdate>) (Hearst, 1992; Riloff, 1996; Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Mann and Yarowsky, 2003; Jijkoun et al., 2004; Mann and Yarowsky, 2005; Alfonseca et al., 2006; Pasca et al., 2006).

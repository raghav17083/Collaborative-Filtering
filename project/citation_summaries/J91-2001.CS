1 For examples of this approach see Dawar and Vijay-Shanker (1990), D6rre and Eisele (1990), Johnson (1988, 1990a, 1990b, 1991a, 1991b, in press a), Karttunen (1984), Kasper (1987a, 1987b, 1988), Kasper and Rounds (1986, 1990), Langholm (1989), Pereira (1987), and Smolka (1992). 
Cyclic feature structures can be prohibited with a constraint formalizable in SB, as described in Johnson (1991b), and one can express a constraint in SB that requires that all attributes are "attribute-value constants" (even though there appears to be no linguistic motivation for such a constraint, and indeed, some analyses crucially depend on this not being the case, as pointed out in Johnson \[1988\]). 
Versions of both of these kinds of constraint, as well as the familiar attribute-value constraints, can be expressed as Scho'nfinkel-Bernays'formulae (as demonstrated in Johnson 1991a, 1991b), so that the problem of determining the satisfiability of a system of such constraints is reduced to the satisfiability problem for the corresponding formula. 
Computing with Features as Formulae Mark Johnson* Brown University This paper extends the approach to feature structures developed in Johnson (1991a), which uses SchO'nfinkel-Bernays' formulae to express feature structure constraints. 
For further examples and a discussion of how the disjunction and negation of attribute-value constraints are transparently representable as SB formulae, see Johnson (1991a, 1991b).

The computational performances of the application reported in (Jacquemin 1994a) indicate that the parser only spends 10% of its time in generating metarules and fully justify the run-time approach.


In Jacquemin (1994b), an algorithm for optimizing the determination of computational anchors is described.


More details about this description are reported in (Jacquemin and Royaut6 1994).

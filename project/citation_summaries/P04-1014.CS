Clark and Curran (2004b) describes log-linear parsing models for CCG. 
249 3 The CCG Parser Clark and Curran (2004b) describes the CCG parser used for the evaluation. 
In this paper we use the Clark and Curran (2004b) parser, which uses a loglinear model of normal-form derivations to select an analysis. 
7 Discussion and related work Experiments on deep parsing of Penn Treebank have been reported for Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Clark and Curran, 2004b) and Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplan et al. , 2004). 
2 The CCG Parsing Model Clark and Curran (2004b) describes two log-linear parsing models for CCG: a normal-form derivation model and a dependency model.

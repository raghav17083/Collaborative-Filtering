Ambiguous pronouns are common in spoken dialog (Poesio & Artstein, 2005), a fact that has to be taken into account when building a spoken dialog pronoun resolution system. 
(Poesio and Artstein, 2005) discusses some better ways of assessing interannotator agreement, particularly when there is a gray area between correct and incorrect annotation. 
Note that our definition of precision is stricter (and yields lower figures) than that applied in the ACE context, as the latter ignores incorrect links between two expressions in the response 8It is a common observation that demonstratives (in particular that) are preferred over it for discourse deictic reference (Schiffman, 1985; Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993; Eckert & Strube, 2000; Byron, 2004; Poesio & Artstein, 2005). 
Such a large hand-annotation effort would be even less sensible in the case of semantic annotation tasks such as coreference or wordsense disambiguation,given on the one side the greater difficulty of agreeing on a neutral theoretical framework, on the other the difficulty of achieving more than moderate agreement on semantic judgments (Poesio and Artstein, 2005). 
A structured link, an innovation of MATE, can represent ambiguity (Poesio & Artstein, 2005).

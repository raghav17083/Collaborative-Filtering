Proposals for annotating coreference such as (Hirschman, 1998) have been motivated by work on Information Extraction, hence the notion of coreference used is very difficult to relate to traditional ideas about anaphora (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000). 
It suffers however from a number of problems (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000), chief among which is the fact that the one semantic relation expressed by the scheme, ident, conflates a number of relations that semanticists view as distinct: besides COREFERENCE proper, there are IDENTITY ANAPHORA, BOUND ANAPHORA, and even PREDICATION. 
van Deemter and Kibble (2000) assume the definition of reference typically found in formal semantics, but in functional linguistics, the term referring expression is used to indicate expressions that introduce new discourse entities in a discourse model or that denote an old one (see, e.g., (Gundel et al. , 1993)). 
1 Introduction Although often treated together, anaphoric pronoun resolution differs from coreference resolution (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000). 
Following van Deemter and Kibble (2000), we define a coreference relation to hold between two 2See nlp.cs.nyu.edu/meyers/pie-in-the-sky/ pie-in-the-sky-descript.html.

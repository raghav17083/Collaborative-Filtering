Further, there is some work on questions arising when AL is to be used in real-life annotation scenarios, including impaired inter-annotator agreement, stopping criteria for AL-driven annotation, and issues of reusability (Baldridge and Osborne, 2004; Hachey et al., 2005; Zhu and Hovy, 2007; Tomanek et al., 2007).

In this sense, the ISC may serve as a complement to stopping criteria requiring the classifier to achieve absolute performance measures before the learning process is aborted, for instance the max-confidence proposed by Zhu and Hovy (2007), and the minimal absolute performance introduced by Laws and Schutze (2008).

Zhu and colleagues (Zhu and Hovy, 2007; Zhu et al., 2008a; Zhu et al., 2008b) introduce max-confidence, min-error, minimum expected error strategy, overall-uncertainty, and classificationchange as means to terminate AL. They primarily use a single-classifier approach to word sense disambiguation and text classification in their experiments.

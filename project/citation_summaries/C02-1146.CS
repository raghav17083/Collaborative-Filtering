W04-2411:1	25:223	Automatic detection of such argument alternations is important to acquisition of verb lexical semantics (Dang et al. , 2000; Dorr and Jones, 2000; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; Tsang et al. , 2002), and moreover, may play a role in automatic processing of language for applied tasks, such as question-answering (Katz et al. , 2001), information extraction (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998), detection of text relations (Teufel, 1999), and determination of verbparticle constructions (Bannard, 2002).

W04-2605:2	14:214	Correspondingly, the relation between alternation patterns and meaning is a key focus in the computational study of the lexical semantics of verbs (e.g. , Allen, 1997; Dang et al. , 2000; Dorr and Jones, 2000; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; Tsang et al. , 2002).

P08-1050:3	15:222	Although there exist several manually-created verb lexicons or ontologies, including Levins verb taxonomy, VerbNet, and FrameNet, automatic verb classification (AVC) is still necessary for extending existing lexicons (Korhonen and Briscoe, 2004), building and tuning lexical information specific to different domains (Korhonen et al., 2006), and bootstrapping verb lexicons for new languages (Tsang et al., 2002).
---------------------------------------------------
J06-2001:4	456:580	The classifications refer to different class criteria, for example, aspectual properties (Siegel and McKeown 2000), syntactic categories (Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Merlo et al. 2002; Tsang, Stevenson, and Merlo 2002), and most similar to my approachsemantic categories (Schulte im Walde 2000; Joanis 2002).

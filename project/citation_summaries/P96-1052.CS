2.2 Related Work for Punctuation Processing Several researchers have provided descriptive treatment of the role of punctuations: Jones (1996b) determined the syntactic function of the punctuation mark.


In English, the average use of comma per sentence is 0.869 (Jones, 1996a) 1 ~1.04(Hill, 1996), and in Chinese it is 1.79 2, which is one and a half to two more times as it is used in English.

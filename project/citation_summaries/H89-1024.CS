4 Cross-Word Triphone Models A model of phonetic coarticulation between words has been proven to be effective by researchers at CMU, SRI, and Lincoln Labs (Paul, 1989; Lee, 1989; Murveit, 1989).


In fact, three research sites (Paul, 1989; Lee, 1989; Murveit, 1989) reported modeling triphone context across word boundaries at the February 1989 meeting.

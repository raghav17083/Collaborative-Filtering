Finally, we plan to apply the model to other paraphrasing tasks including fully abstractive document summarisation (Daume III and Marcu, 2002). 
Between these two extremes, there has been a relatively modest amount of work in sentence simplification (Chandrasekar, Doran, and Bangalore 1996; Mahesh 1997; Carroll et al. 1998; Grefenstette 1998; Jing 2000; Knight and Marcu 2002) and document compression (Daume III and Marcu 2002; Daume III and Marcu 2004; Zajic, Dorr, and Schwartz 2004) in which words, phrases, and sentences are selected in an extraction process. 
For content selection, discourse-level considerations were proposed by Daume III and Marcu (2002), who explored the use of Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988). 
In our own work on document compression models (Daume III and Marcu 2002; Daume III and Marcu 2004), both of which extend the sentence compression model of Knight and Marcu (2002), we assume that sentences and documents can be summarized exclusively through deletion of contiguous text segments. 
It has been further observed that simply compressing sentences individually and concatenating the results leads to suboptimal summaries (Daume III and Marcu, 2002).

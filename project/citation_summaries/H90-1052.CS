Also, these collocations have been used by an automatic parser in order to resolve attachment ambiguities (Hindle and Rooth 1990). 
Since many of the headwords in the 20,000 word corpus are not of import in the MUC-3 domain, their semantic type is vague, i.e., <unknown event>, <unknown entity>, etc. 4.4 Related Work In addition to the work discussed earlier on tools to increase the portability of natural language systems, another recent paper (Hindle and Rooth 1990) is directly related to our goal of inferring case frame information from examples. 
More specifically, two recent works have suggested to use statistical data on lexical relations for resolving ambiguity cases of PP-attachment (Hindle and Rooth, 1990) and pronoun references (Dagan and Itai, 1990a; Dagan and Itai, 1990b).

Hindle and Rooth (1990) later refined this approach by using bigram statistics to enhance the task of prepositional phrase attachment.

Many recent efforts have also focused on extracting binary semantic relations between entities, such as entailments (Szpektor et al. 2004), is-a (Ravichandran and Hovy 2002), part-of (Girju et al. 2003), and other relations. 
Recently, several algorithms were proposed for automatically learning entailment rules and paraphrases (viewed as bi-directional entailment rules) (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama et al., 2002; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005). 
Yet the current precision of acquisition algorithms is typically still mediocre, as illustrated in Table 1 for DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001) and TEASE (Szpektor et al. , 2004), two prominent acquisition algorithms whose outputs are publicly available. 
In paraphrase generation, a text unit that matches a pattern P can be rewritten using the paraphrase patterns of P.

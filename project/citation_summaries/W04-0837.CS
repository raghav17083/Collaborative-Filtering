We used WordNet 1.7.1 (Fellbaum, 1998) senses.3 We compared our results to a baseline that selects for each word type a random sense, assumes it is the dominant one, and uses it to disambiguate all instances of the target word (McCarthy et al. , 2004a). 
This paper only deals with nouns, however we have recently investigated the ranking method for an unsupervised predominant sense heuristic for WSD for other PoS (McCarthy et al. , 2004b). 
The ranking method is described elsewhere (McCarthy et al. , 2004a), but we summarise in the following section and describe how ranking scores can be used for filtering word senses. 
We are currently investigating the performance of the first sense heuristic, and this method, for other PoS on SENSEVAL-3 data (McCarthy et al. , 2004), although not yet with rankings from domain specific corpora. 
More recently, (McCarthy et al. , 2004) reports one of the best results on the SENSEVAL-2 data set, using an algorithm that automatically derives the most frequent sense for a word using distributional similarities learned from a large raw corpus, for a disambiguation precision of 53.0% and a recall of 49.0%.

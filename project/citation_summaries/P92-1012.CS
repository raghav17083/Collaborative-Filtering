Unfortunately, the general problem of parsing ill-nested structures is NPcomplete, even when the gap degree is bounded: this set of structures is closely related to LCFRS with bounded fan-out and unbounded production length, and parsing in this formalism has been proven to be NP-complete (Satta, 1992). 
Specifically, parsers for well-nested grammar formalisms are not confronted with the crossing configurations that make the universal recognition problem of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems NP-complete (Satta, 1992). 
This gives rise to a notion of regular dependency languages, and allows us to establish a formal relation between the structural constraints and mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms (Joshi, 1985): We show that regular dependency languages correspond to the sets of derivations of lexicalized Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (lcfrs) (Vijay-Shanker et al. , 1987), and that the gap-degree measure is the structural correspondent of the concept of fan-out in this formalism (Satta, 1992). 
In particular, chart-based parsers for grammar formalisms in which derivations obey the well-nestedness constraint (such as Tree Adjoining Grammar) are not hampered by the crossing configurations to which Satta (1992) attributes the fact that the universal recognition problem of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems isNP-complete. 
The gap degree 1Parsing unrestricted ill-nested structures, even when the gap degree is bounded, is NP-complete: these structures are equivalent to LCFRS for which the recognition problem is NP-complete (Satta, 1992).

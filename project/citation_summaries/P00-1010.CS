Several works have addressed the problems of representing temporal information in natural language (Setzer, 2001; Hobbs and Pan, 2004; Saur et al. , 2006), extracting and/or anchoring (normalizing) temporal and event related expressions (Wiebe et al. , 1998; Mani and Wilson, 2000; Schilder and Habel, 2001; Vazov, 2001; Filatova and Hovy, 2001), and discovering the ordering of events (Mani et al. , 2003). 
Linguistic Processing The time expression tagger TempEx (Mani and Wilson 2000) tags and assigns values to temporal expressions, both absolute expressions like June 1, 2001 and relative expressions like Monday. 
As a result, many timex interpretation systems are a mixture of both rule-based and machine learning approaches (Mani and Wilson, 2000). 
Mani and Wilson (2000) call this class TIMEX expression (of type TIME or DATE). 
We are using the components for timex recognition and normalisation (Mani and Wilson, 2000), event extraction (Saur et al., 2005a), and identification of modal contexts (Saur et al., 2006).3 3 Informed Projection 3.1 The Core Algorithm Recall that TimeML represents temporal entities with EVENT and TIMEX3 tags which are anchored to words in the text.

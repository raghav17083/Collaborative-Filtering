In the area of speech recognition, to improve the accuracy of the language models, clustering the training data is considered to be a promising method for automatic training(Carter, 1994; Iyer et al., 1994).


1 Introduction Topic-dependent modeling has proven to be an effective way to improve quality the quality of models in speech recognition (Iyer and Osendorf, 1994; Carter, 1994).


For this clustering, the following extension of monolingual corpus clustering is employed (Carter 1994).

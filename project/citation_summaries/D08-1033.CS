Recently, methods from nonparametric Bayesian statistics have been gaining popularity as a way to approach unsupervised learning for a variety of tasks, including language modeling, word and morpheme segmentation, parsing, and machine translation (Teh et al., 2006; Goldwater et al., 2006a; Goldwater et al., 2006b; Liang et al., 2007; Finkel et al., 2007; DeNero et al., 2008). 
Two methods are commonly used for approximate inference: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (DeNero et al., 2008), and Variational Bayesian (VB) inference (Blunsom et al., 2008). 
1 Introduction Non-parametric Bayesian methods have been successfully applied to directly learn phrase pairs from a bilingual corpus with little or no dependence on word alignments (Blunsom et al., 2008; DeNeroetal., 2008). 
We can also use Bayesian inference techniques to avoid resorting to heuristics that damage the probabilistic interpretation of the models (Zhang et al., 2008; DeNero et al., 2008; Blunsom et al., 2009). 
The other extensively studied approach is to replacethephraseextractionheuristicwithamethod that better matches the use of the extracted phrases (see, e.g., (Marcu and Wong, 2002; DeNero et al., 2008) and the references therein).

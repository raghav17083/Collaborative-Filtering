It carries out inference using a Metropoliswithin-Gibbs algorithm (Johnson et al., 2007), in which it repeatedly parses each input line using the CYK algorithm, samples a parse, and proposes this as the new tree. 
c2008 Association for Computational Linguistics Using adaptor grammars to identify synergies in the unsupervised acquisition of linguistic structure Mark Johnson Brown University Mark Johnson@Brown.edu Abstract Adaptor grammars (Johnson et al., 2007b) are a non-parametric Bayesian extension of Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) which in effect learn the probabilities of entire subtrees. 
In the monolingual setting, there is a wellknown tree sampling algorithm (Johnson et al., 2007). 
As a framework for our models, we adopt adaptor grammars (Johnson et al., 2007), a framework for non-parametric Bayesian inference over contextfree grammars. 
Our use of Gibbs sampling follows from its increasing use in Bayesian inference problems in NLP (Finkel et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2007b).

The lemma of the token is extracted from parse trees generated by the CONTEX parser (Hermjakob and Mooney, 1997) which includes rich context information in parse trees, and the Brill tagger (Brill, 1992) is used for POS tagging. 
4 Learning to Parse We base our training on the machine learning based approach of (Hermjakob k: Mooney, 1997), allowing however unrestricted text and deriving the parse action sequences required for training from a treebank. 
This contrasts with approaches where there are essentially no explicit rules, such as neural networks (e.g. \[Buo 1996\]), or approaches where the machine learning algorithms attempt to infer--via deduction (e.g. \[Samuelsson 1994\]), induction (e.g. \[Theeramunkong et al. 1997\]; \[Zelle & Mooney 1994\]) under user cooperation (e.g. \[Simmons & Yu 1992\]; \[Hermjakob & Mooney 1997\]), transformation-based error-driven learning (e.g. \[Brill 1993\]), or even decision trees (e.g. \[Magerman 1995\])--a grammar from raw or preprocessed data. 
Another example of automatic feature selection for parsing is in the context of a deterministic parsing model that chooses parse actions based on automatically induced decision structures over a very rich feature set (Hermjakob and Mooney, 1997). 
For instance, Hermjakob and Mooney (1997) have described a learning system that can build a deterministic shiftreduce parser from a small set of training examples with the aid of detailed morphological, syntactical, and semantic knowledge databases and step-by-step guidance from human experts.

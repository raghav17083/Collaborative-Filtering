In this paper, we use the eXtensible MetaGrammar (XMG) tool which was developed by Crabbe 1But several attempts have been made to explicitly add functions to TAG, e.g. by Kameyama (1986) to retain the benefits of both TAG and LFG, or by Prolo (2006) to account for the coordination of constituents of different categories, yet sharing the same function.

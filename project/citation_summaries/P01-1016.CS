For the REA agent (Cassell et al. , 2001a), for example, gesturing behaviour was selected to perform particular communicative functions, using rules based on studies of typical North American non-verbal displays. 
The discourse structure hierarchy has been shown to be useful for other tasks: understanding specific lexical and prosodic phenomena (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996; Levow, 2004), natural language generation (Hovy, 1993), predictive/generative models of postural shifts (Cassell et al. , 2001), and essay scoring (Higgins et al. , 2004). 
3 Suggesting ECA behaviour for each dialogue situation A variety of studies have been carried out on behavioural strategies for embodied conversational agents (Poggi, 2001; Cassell et al. , 2000; Cassell et al. , 2001; Chovil, 1992; Kendon, 1990), which deal with behaviour in hypothetical situations and in terms of the informational goals of each particular interaction (be it human-human or humanmachine). 
Average (standard deviation) for objective metrics in the first problem 6 Related work Discourse structure has been successfully used in non-interactive settings (e.g. understanding specific lexical and prosodic phenomena (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996), natural language generation (Hovy, 1993), essay scoring (Higgins et al. , 2004) as well as in interactive settings (e.g. predictive/generative models of postural shifts (Cassell et al. , 2001), generation/interpretation of anaphoric expressions (Allen et al. , 2001), performance modeling (Rotaru and Litman, 2006)). 
Another important area of research is the generation of multimodal communication in animated agents (e.g. , (Cassell et al. , 2001; Kopp et al. , 2006; Nakano et al. , 2003)).

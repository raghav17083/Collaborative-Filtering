We use the Microsoft paraphrase corpus (Dolan et al. , 2004), consisting of 4,076 training pairs and 1,725 test pairs, and determine the number of correctly identified paraphrase pairs in the corpus using the text semantic similarity measure as the only indicator of paraphrasing. 
7 Related Work There is a growing body of research that uses the MSRPC (Dolan et al., 2004; Quirk et al., 2004) to build models of paraphrase. 
3.4 Perspectives for automatic paraphrase extraction There is a growing amount of work on automatic extraction of paraphrases from text corpora (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Ibrahim et al., 2003; Dolan et al., 2004). 
There exist many different string similarity measures: word overlap (Tomuro and Lytinen, 2004), longest common subsequence (Islamand Inkpen,2007), Levenshteinedit distance (Dolan et al., 2004), word n-gramoverlap (Barzilay and Lee, 2003) etc. Semantic similarity measures are obtained by first computing the semantic similarity of the words containedin the sentencesbeing compared. 
3.1 Datasets We mainly used the Microsoft Research (MSR) Paraphrasing Corpus (Dolan et al., 2004), which consists of 5,801 pairs of sentences.

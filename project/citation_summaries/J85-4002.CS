This approach is generally associated with the use of either:  A phrasal lexicon such as in the generation systems ANA (Kukich 1983a), PI-IRF.D (Jacobs 1985) and PAULINE (Hovy 1988). 
A particularly interesting aspect is that the system had also a twin generator, called PHRED (Jacobs 1985), that reversed the process, as both are based on the same linguistic representation. 
While some researchers have directly associated words with each concept in the domain-knowledge base (e.g. , Reiter 1991; Swartout 1983), this approach does not allow for consideration of syntactic and lexical constraints unless a phrasal lexicon is used (e.g. , Kukich 1983b; Danlos 1986; Jacobs 1985; Hovy 1988). 
In addition to exploiting the formal MRL grammar, our approach also allows the same learned grammar to be used for both parsing and generation, an elegant property that has been widely advocated (Kay, 1975; Jacobs, 1985; Shieber, 1988). 
7o Related Work While not adhering strictly to any familiar theoretical framework, tbe present model has aspects in common with the Phlusal Lexicon approach, (e.g. , Jacobs 1985, Zemik & Dyer forthcoming), with plu'ase-oriented work in linguistics and psycholinguistics (e.g. , Filhnore, Kay, & O'Connor 1986, Pawley & Syder 1983, PeteJs 1983), with other localized eonnectionist models (e.g. , Cottrell & Small 1983, Waltz & Pollack 1985), ram with psychological models making use of spreading activation (e.g. , Dell 1986, MacKay 1987).

We do not use particular lexicosyntactic patterns, as previous attempts have (Hearst, 1992; Caraballo, 1999; Imasumi, 2001; Fleischman et al. , 2003; Morin and Jacquemin, 2003; Ando et al. , 2003). 
1 Motivation Question Answering has emerged as a key area in natural language processing (NLP) to apply question parsing, information extraction, summarization, and language generation techniques (Clark et al. , 2004; Fleischman et al. , 2003; Echihabi et al. , 2003; Yang et al. , 2003; Hermjakob et al. , 2002; Dumais et al. , 2002). 
The precision of the extracted information can be improved significantly by using machine learning methods to filter out noise (Fleischman et al. , 2003). 
1 Introduction Hyponymy relations can play a crucial role in various NLP systems, and there have been many attempts to develop automatic methods to acquire hyponymy relations from text corpora (Hearst, 1992; Caraballo, 1999; Imasumi, 2001; Fleischman et al. , 2003; Morin and Jacquemin, 2003; Ando et al. , 2003). 
In contrast, the idea of bootstrapping for relation and information extraction was first proposed in (Riloff and Jones, 1999), and successfully applied to the construction of semantic lexicons (Thelen and Riloff, 2002), named entity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999), extraction of binary relations (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000), and acquisition of structured data for tasks such as Question Answering (Lita and Carbonell, 2004; Fleischman et al. , 2003).

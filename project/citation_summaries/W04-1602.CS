This is possible because of the availability of statistical parsers, which can be trained on human-annotated treebanks (Marcus et al. , 1993; Xia et al. , 2000; Maamouri and Bies, 2004) for multiple languages; (2) The binding theory is used as a guideline and syntactic structures are encoded as features in a maximum entropy coreference system; (3) The syntactic features are evaluated on three languages: Arabic, Chinese and English (one goal is to see if features motivated by the English language can help coreference resolution in other languages). 
As for parser, we train three off-shelf maximum-entropy parsers (Ratnaparkhi, 1999) using the Arabic, Chinese and English Penn treebank (Maamouri and Bies, 2004; Xia et al. , 2000; Marcus et al. , 1993). 
(1) (S (NP-SBJ I) (VP consider (S (NP-SBJ Kris) (NP-PRD a fool)))) The team working on the ATB found this approach very convenient for copula constructions in Arabic, which are mainly verbless (Maamouri and Bies, 2004). 
Here, we extend the LFG grammar acquisition approach to Arabic and the Penn Arabic Treebank (ATB) (Maamouri and Bies, 2004), adaptingandextendingthemethodology of (Cahill and al., 2004) originally developed for English. 
In this paper we describe the porting of the LFG annotation methodology to Arabic in order to induce LFG f-structures from the Penn Arabic Treebank (ATB) (Bies, 2003), (Maamouri and Bies, 2004).

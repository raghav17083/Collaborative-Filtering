These dialogue interfaces also provide an opportunity for task efficacy evaluation, as discussed above, and there are already many examples of dialogue systems being tested in field trials with representative populations of users (Danieli and Gerbino \[1995\], Kamm \[1995\], Meng et al. \[1996\], Sadek et al. \[1996\] inter alia). 
For example, a typical NLP system, such as TRAINS (Allen et al. , 1996), employs different knowledge representations for parsing, action planning and generation, despite the fact that what is being represented is common to all those representations, e. g., the parser representation for going from A to B has no similarity to the action planners representation thereof (Ferguson et al. , 1996). 
Figure 6 4 shows an example of semantic error correction process using the same data in TRAIN-95 (Allen et al. , 1996). 
Recent work includes discussion of appropriate statistical methods and metrics for spoken dialogue systems (Bates and Ayuso 1993; Danieli et al. 1992; Hirschman et al. 1990; Hirschman and Pao 1993; Simpson and Fraser 1993), information extraction systems (Lewis 1991; Chinchor, Hirschman, and Lewis 1993; Chinchor and Sundheim 1995), and tagging reliability (Carletta 1996). 
In addition to the works mentioned above, there have been several classic projects in the area of natural language dialogue like TRAINS/TRIPS project at Rochester (Allen et al. , 1989, 1995, 1996), Duke's Circuit-FixitShoppe and Pascal Tutoring System (Biermann et al. , 1997; 1995), etc. While the Circuit-FixitShoppe system helps users fix a circuit through a dialogue with the system, the TRIPS and the TRAINS projects allow users to plan their itineraries through dialogue.

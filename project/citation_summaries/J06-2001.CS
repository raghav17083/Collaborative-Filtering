Joanis (2002) and Schulte im Walde (2006) used SP-based features in general English and German verb classifications, respectively. 
1 Introduction Recent research shows that it is possible, using current natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technology, to automatically induce lexical classes from corpus data with promising accuracy (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Korhonen et al., 2003; Schulte im Walde, 2006; Joanis et al., 2007). 
Some have supplemented them with further information about verb tense, voice, and/or semantic selectional preferences on argument heads.2 The preliminary experiment on biomedical verb classification (Korhonen et al., 2006) employed basic syntactic features only: SCFs extracted from corpus data using the system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997) which operates on the output of a domain-independent robust statistical parser (RASP) (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002). 
A variety of systems for identifying temporal relations were trained on this corpus (Boguraev and Ando, 2005; Mani et al., 2006) but systems had poor performance, in part due to the the low interannotator agreement and fine granularity of the TimeBank temporal relations. 
Work more directly comparableto ours includes Schulte im Walde (2003, 2006) who presents a method for clustering German verbs by linguistically motivated feature selection.

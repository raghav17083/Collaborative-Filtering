This is reported in studies of manual annotation of phrases (Takamura et al. , 2006), recognizing contextual polarity of expressions (Wilson et al. , 2005), and sentiment tagging of words and word senses (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). 
2 Motivation Automatic subjectivity analysis methods have been used in a wide variety of text processing applications, such as tracking sentiment timelines in online forums and news (Lloyd et al. , 2005; Balog et al. , 2006), review classification (Turney, 2002; Pang et al. , 2002), mining opinions from product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004), automatic expressive text-to-speech synthesis (Alm et al. , 2005), text semantic analysis (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), and question answering (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003). 
Some authors go a step further and attach these properties not to terms but to term senses (typically: WordNet synsets), on the assumption that different senses of the same term may have different opinion-related properties (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006a; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006b; Ide, 2006; Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006). 
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006); Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006)). 
Researchers have found this at various levels of analysis, including the manual annotation of phrases (Takamura et al., 2006), sentiment classification of phrases (Wilson et al., 2005), sentiment tagging of words (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006b), and sentiment tagging of word senses (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006a).

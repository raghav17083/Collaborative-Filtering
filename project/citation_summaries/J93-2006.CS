TECHNICAL APPROACH Our approach is a synthesis of statistical and linguistic models of language, embodied for MUC-6 in the PLU M system (Probabilistic Language Understanding Model) . We began this research in 1991 and applied it that year i n MUC-3 . Since that time, we have successfully applied probabilistic models to the following :  part of speech tagging, using Hidden Markov Models (Weischedel, et al ., 1993),  judgments of relevance of text (at the paragraph level) via a log odds model (Ayuso, et al ., 1992),  learning semantic information (selection restrictions, or case frames) from supervised training (Weischedel, et. 
In our framework, we employ a simple HMM-based tagger, where the most probable tag sequence, a29a30, given the words, a31, is output (Weischedel et al. , 1993): a29 a30 a20a22a32a34a33a36a35a38a37a39a32a41a40 a42 a43a45a44 a30a47a46 a31a49a48a17a20a22a32a34a33a50a35a38a37a39a32a41a40 a42 a43a45a44 a31 a46a30 a48 a43a51a44 a30 a48 Since we do not have enough data which is manually tagged with part-of-speech tags for our applications, we used Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. , 1994) as our training set. 
Word features are introduced primarily to help with unknown words, as in (Weischedel et al. 1993).

Previous uses of this model include language modeling(Lau et al. , 1993), machine translation(Berger et al. , 1996), prepositional phrase attachment(Ratnaparkhi et al. , 1994), and word morphology(Della Pietra et al. , 1995).

In particular, we like to test whether our method extracts the same groups of senses which human annotators disagreed (Ng et al. , 1999). 
Unfortunately, the subset of the \[:)SO corpus studied by (Ng et al. , 1999) and that used in this report are not the same and, thus, a direct comparison is not possible. 
11 (Ng et al. , 1999) reports a higher agreement of 57%. 
Then we measured the possible increase in  by our lexicon by taking the dierence between the paired  values for all words (i.e. ,  w by our sense partition  w by random partition, for a word w), and performed a signi cance 12 (Ng et al. 1999)'s result is slightly higher:  = :317. 
Factors that have been proposed as affecting human or system sense disambiguation include whether annotators are allowed to assign multilabels (Veronis, 1998; Ide et al., 2002; Passonneau et al., 2006), the number or granularity of senses (Ng et al., 1999), merging of related senses (Snow et al., 2007), sense similarity (Chugur et al., 2002), sense perplexity (Diab, 2004), entropy (Diab, 2004; Palmer et al., 2005), and in psycholinguistic experiments, reactions times required to distinguish senses (Klein and Murphy, 2002; Ide and Wilks, 2006).

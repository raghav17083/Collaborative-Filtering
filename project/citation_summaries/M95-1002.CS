6 Related work Relations of types that we have here termed static have figured prominently in the MUC and ACE series of events that have largely defined the general domain IE research program (Sundheim, 1995; Doddington et al., 2004). 
2 The Corpora The definition of the NE task we discuss in this paper was taken from the guidelines for the Sixth Message Understanding Conferences (MUC-6) (Sundheim, 1995a) and the recent Multilingual Entity Task (MET, May 1996), both sponsored by the TIPSTER program. 
In particular, information extraction (IE) systems like those built in the DARPA Message Understanding Conferences (Chinchor 1998; Sundheim 1995) have revealed that coreference resolution is such a critical component of IE systems that a separate coreference subtask has been defined and evaluated since MUC-6 (MUC-6 1995). 
IE systems typically focus on information about events that are relevant to a specific domain, such as terrorism (Sundheim, 1992; Soderland et al. , 1995; Riloff, 1996; Chieu et al. , 2003), management succession (Sundheim, 1995; Yangarber et al. , 2000), or job announcements (Califf and Mooney, 1999; Freitag and McCallum, 2000). 
For example, the best F-score in the shared task of Bio-NER in COLING 2004 JNLPBA (Kim et al. , 2004) was 72.55% (Zhou and Su, 2004) 1, whereas the best performance at MUC-6, in which systems tried to identify general named entities such as person or organization names, was an accuracy of 95% (Sundheim, 1995).

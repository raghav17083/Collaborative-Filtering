This Preference Factor is extremely important in achieving success by the 15 This constraint is suggested in Hardt (1992). 
The same method has been applied to empirically testing an algorithm for resolving verb phrase ellipsis (Hardt 1992). 
11 This constraint is discussed in Hardt (1992). 
Other cases, such as VP anaphora (Hardt 1992), temporal anaphora (Kameyama, Passonneau, and Poesio 1993; Hitzeman, Moens, and Grover 1995) have already been examined within the centering model. 
This work builds on structural constraints and discourse heuristics first proposed in Hardt (1992) and further developed in Hardt (1995).

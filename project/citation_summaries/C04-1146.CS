The most widely used association weight function is (point-wise) Mutual Information (MI) (Church and Hanks, 1990; Lin, 1998; Dagan, 2000; Weeds et al. , 2004). 
We want to investigate the effect of frequency and choice of distributional similarity measure (Weeds et al. , 2004). 
For example (Lee, 1997; Weeds et al. , 2004) compare similarity metrics such as the Cosine, Manhattan and Euclidean distances, Kullback-Leibler divergence, Jensen-Shannon divergence, and Jaccards Coefficient, that could be applied in general clustering tasks, on the task of measuring distributional similarity. 
Our notion of entailment is 113 based on the concept of distributional generality (Weeds et al., 2004), a generalisation of the distributional hypothesis of Harris (1985), in which it is assumed that terms with a more general meaning will occur in a wider array of contexts, an idea later developed by Geffet and Dagan (2005). 
Many studies (Lee, 1999; Curran and Moens, 2002; Weeds et al., 2004) have investigated similarity calculation, and a variety of distance/similarity measures have already been compared and discussed.
